The percentages presented here were calculated based on absolute emissions reduction compared to year 2000 as base year. We set our mid-term and long-term absolute targets for 2030 and 2050, respectively, starting from 2017.  In the mid-term, Nissan will not be able to reach an average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2030 of at least 2.1%; on the contrary, a slight absolute emissions increase of 0.8% a year is expected to be observed for this period.   However, according to our internal study, Nissan predicts that the penetration of its EVs will accelerate substantially in the long term, and absolute CO2 emissions will drop steeply from the mid-2030s. Indeed, the average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2050 is 2.12%, which means that the contribution of EVs is one of the most important aspects in our long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions according to our target.  The percentages were calculated dividing the difference in emissions between start year and target year in relation to base year emissions.  In 2008, Nissan realised that further reductions also in terms of intensity may be necessary as suggested by the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. 450ppm represents the scenarios of Category I, and change in global CO2 emissions 2050 need to be half (50%) of 2000 which is re-calculated in WtW as -90%  in 2050, which is an intensity target applied for new vehicles (in g-C02/km).  In order to translate -50% absolute IPCC requirement to the WtW -90% intensity, the estimated 2050 vehicle volume shown in IEA’s Mobility Model is adopted. Nissan understands that current IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report needs to revise its base year to 2010, and SBT methods are following the calculations accordingly. Nissan believes that the base year 2000 scenario is equivalent or more stringent than the 2010 scenarios. Nissan has submitted the SBT for Target Quality Check to SBTI.',\n",

This target was originally set using the SDA methodology, based on a 2-degree warming scenario, using a 2015 base year and a total projected growth rate (in square meters) of 10% during the period. The target had to be recalculated to take into account all acquisitions and divestment's, in line with the recalculation policy of Emira. The Base year was thus adjusted from 217127 tonnes, to 172970 tonnes CO2e. It is important to note that :  1. Emira uses an equity share approach to calculate emissions, and therefore Emira's scope 3 emissions are marginal. All Investments and tenant emissions are included as scope 1 and 2 emissions as per this equity consolidation approach, 2. The properties that are not in direct control of Emira are included in these targets, however, Emira has allocated all emission reduction targets internally to directly controlled properties only. This in effect makes the directly controlled target significantly more ambitious than 13%.  The total scope 1 and 2 emissions at 2019 equated to 161661 tonnes CO2e. The absolute target at 2023 is 13% of 172970 or 150484 tonnes CO2e. So, Emira has achieved 50% of the target.  Emira is considering revising the target to one in line with the 1.5-degree warming scenario, which will be much more onerous.

In the mid-term, Nissan will not be able to reach an average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2030 of at least 2.1%; on the contrary, a slight absolute emissions increase of 0.8% a year is expected to be observed for this period.   However, according to our internal study, Nissan predicts that the penetration of its EVs will accelerate substantially in the long term, and absolute CO2 emissions will drop steeply from the mid-2030s. Indeed, the average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2050 is 2.12%, which means that the contribution of EVs is one of the most important aspects in our long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions according to our target.  The percentages were calculated dividing the difference in emissions between start year and target year in relation to base year emissions.  In 2008, Nissan realised that further reductions also in terms of intensity may be necessary as suggested by the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. 450ppm represents the scenarios of Category I, and change in global CO2 emissions 2050 need to be half (50%) of 2000 which is re-calculated in WtW as -90%  in 2050, which is an intensity target applied for new vehicles (in g-C02/km).  In order to translate -50% absolute IPCC requirement to the WtW -90% intensity, the estimated 2050 vehicle volume shown in IEA’s Mobility Model is adopted. Nissan understands that current IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report needs to revise its base year to 2010, and SBT methods are following the calculations accordingly. Nissan believes that the base year 2000 scenario is equivalent or more stringent than the 2010 scenarios. Nissan has submitted the SBT for Target Quality Check to SBTI, and the verifications to the Science Based Target Initiatives is under process.',\n",

       " 5143: \"Abt has set a goal to decarbonize by 2050, with an interim 25% reduction target by 2021 compared to our 2012 base year. The scope of this absolute emissions reduction target includes Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 (upstream) from our U.S.-based operations. Abt Associates was able to achieve our interim absolute reduction target in 2017. Emissions from 2012-2018 have been externally verified to a reasonable level of assurance for Scope 1 and 2, and limited assurance for Scope 3 emissions. Emissions from 2019 and 2020 will be externally verified during the 2021 calendar year, as per our biennial verification cycle. To date, Abt has achieved a 71.7% emissions reduction. In 2020, we expanded our inventory to include emissions sources from telecommuting as this became material during COVID-19, accounting for 17% of our total 2020 emissions.  Having met and exceeded the initial emission reduction target, in 2020 Abt developed our new target for 2025 (Abt’s fiscal year 2026, Q3), aligned with our next five-year strategy. This updated target is aligned with the latest climate science to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement—to limit global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. Finally, we plan to seek verification with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). Abt's new target is to reduce our global emissions by 33% compared to 2019 levels – our new base year. This target has an expanded scope that includes Abt Australia and Abt Britain operations, and expanded emission sources (i.e., telecommuting and project site offices) to follow best practices and capture the true extent of Abt’s carbon footprint. Abt used the Absolute Contraction Approach methodology, defined in terms of an overall reduction in the amount of emissions emitted into the atmosphere by the target year (2050) relative to the base year, to set the minimum threshold of our intended reduction target. Abt's new 2019 base year reflects our pre-pandemic actions globally. As Abt completes verification of our global emissions inventory for 2019 and 2020, we will include these updated values and scopes as part of our response to the CDP for the 2022 reporting cycle.\",\n",

The targets were validated in May 2020 (Michelin submitted for all 3 scopes since scope 3 emissions are greater than 40% of the total). On scopes 1 and 2, Michelin committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2030 from a 2010 base year (abs1). To date Michelin is on track to meet this scope 1 and 2 ambition by 2030. Beyond this, Michelin has set a new long-term ambition to reach Zero Net Emissions on scopes 1 and 2 by 2050 (Abs2).

For us this scenario translates to 3,1 % year on year emission reductions. Scope 2 calculation in this context is based on market based accounting methodology and the key areas to manage climate impact are to continue our work on improving our energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy. Targets cover all greenhouse gases listed in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard. Target has been approved by the Science-based target initiative’s official target quality check. In 2019, Tetra Pak reached a 53%  reduction in scope 1+2 emissions compared to our 2015 baseline.

       " 5756: 'Michelin has a long-term ambition to halve its Scope 1 & 2 emissions between 2010 and 2050. Intermediary targets are being prepared to guide this process. Note: Michelin is in the process of having its science-based targets (SBT) formally approved by the SBT Initiative. Michelin is covering all 3 scopes since scope 3 emissions are greater than 40% of the total. On scopes 1 and 2, reducing emissions from 2010 base year will necessitate reducing annual emissions to 2830410 metric tons while absorbing our organic growth. To date Michelin is on track to meet this scope 1 and 2 ambition by 2030. Recalculation of base year emissions for SBTi submission: As described in our 2015 registration document (p 178), the same emission factor was used until 2014 for all of the sites purchasing steam, regardless of the primary energy or technology used by the vendor.  As of 2015, in order to more accurately depict foreseeable developments in energy sourcing, we decided to use three emissions factors, one for each primary energy used (coal, fuel oil and gas), including reasonable energy efficiency and loss assumptions.  When we were preparing our submission to SBTi and, in this framework, we recalculated our 2010 (base year) emissions with the new emission factors (EF) applied to steam purchases: with the new EFs, our 2010 emissions would have been 3,850,000 tonnes instead of 4,067,000. For simplicity reasons in our internal communication and target setting, our short term, non-submitted to SBTi 2020 target set is still based on our historical 2010 emission value (4,067,000 tonnes). However, the recalculated 2010 base-year emissions (3,850,000 tonnes) is the basis for our SBTi submission (2030 and 2050 targets).',\n",

Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project, is included among the transition scenarios mentioned by TCFD and coherent with the containment targets of the global temperature defined in the Paris agreement 2. the calculation model Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA) proposed by Science Based Target (SBT).. In relation to the SDA scenario, pathways reduction rates were defined for the years 2019-2030 and 2019-2050 which provide for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the our production activities for scope 1 & 2 and for global CO2 emissions. The above scenario models have been revised and updated to include within boundary the Russian branch’s, Palladio BNM, production site in Obninsk and the Poliweb Graphics in Gossolengo (Piacenza), company acquired in March which produces labels for the healthcare sector. Consequently, base year, data and targets have been adjusted to take in count the boundary variation.  In particularly the base year has been recalculated as business as usual scenario using the residual mix emission factor, where available, to be aligned with target reduction marked based approach. The medium time frame criteria have been satisfied, considering that the Target year is between 5 and 15 more than the year target was set to.  The targets meet at least a 2.1% year-on-year emissions reduction between base year and target year; in fact the average year-on-year reduction value is 3.3%.

This plan reflects Rémy Cointreau’s commitment to developing a strategy in which carbon neutrality and the fight against global warming are key.  This method was used to set the target for the reduction in the Group’s carbon emissions across all its businesses (scopes 1, 2 and 3).  The SBT method was rolled out across the Group’s businesses and enabled the following carbon emissions reduction targets to be set, based on the 2018/2019 carbon footprint assessment:  Targets 2025: CO2 emissions reduction rate – Scopes 1 & 2, in absolute terms: 25% CO2 emissions reduction rate –Scope 3, in intensity: 28%  Targets 2030: CO2 emissions reduction rate – Scopes 1 & 2, in absolute terms: 50% CO2 emissions reduction rate –Scope 3, in intensity: 50%  Targets 2050 (Carbon neutrality): CO2 emissions reduction rate – Scopes 1 & 2, in absolute terms: 70% CO2 emissions reduction rate –Scope 3, in intensity: 70%  Over the coming months, several working groups within Rémy Cointreau will have the task of transforming these targets into actions.

This strategic roadmap was structured around the target of cutting the Group’s carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 (relative to 2015 levels), encompassing its entire value chain (scopes 1, 2 and 3). In doing so, the Group was the first listed real estate company to incorporate CSR in its entire value chain and address the wide scope of indirect carbon emissions resulting from construction works, transportation of visitors and employees, and energy consumption by tenants.  Target status in reporting : In 2019, following the acquisition of Westfield Company by Unibail-Rodamco, and as part of URW’s global integration agenda, the Group’s CSR strategy Better Places 2030 was extended to all regions of the Group in 2019, now also operating in the UK and US. In this revised version of the strategy, URW’s long-term ambition to halve its carbon footprint by 2030 remains central. In order to reach this objective, the carbon reduction sub-targets of the Group on operations and transport have been updated in 2019 to ensure feasibility in the context of the new Group. Furthermore, 2015 base year emissions have been recalculated in 2019 properly on a Group wide consolidated scope, with a consistent and updated methodology. Thus, in 2019 CDP response, 2015 base year emissions were updated to disclose consolidated URW Group past emissions consistently with the carbon footprint baseline recalculation.  SBTI: In 2019, with the support of independent experts, the Group was able to verify that its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is in line with the mitigation efforts necessary to keep global warming below 2°C.
