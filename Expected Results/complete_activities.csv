In 2012 Adobe adopted a cloud strategy for all products which not only made it easier and more efficient for customers to use Adobe products, but it also dematerialized our entire physical supply chain, eliminated all downstream waste and emissions from the businesses, all material waste and emissions from transportation and logistics throughout each product's lifecycle, and decreased the environmental impact of the customers by a minimum of 70% (at that time), with an average greater than 90% reduction, and greater than 95% when customers use Adobe products from a mobile device. The goal has been to achieve 100% digital download of products by 2020 -- this goal was achieved in early 2019 with 100% of all Adobe products delivered digitally and zero emissions from all previous physical supply chains.  An added benefit of putting this upstream purchased goods & services goal in place has been to engage with suppliers throughout the value chain to help them set and meet RE100 and SBT goals.  Because of this, in 2019 Adobe set a brand new Scope 3 emissions SBT of committing that 55% of suppliers (by spend) will set SBTs by 2025 (this is equivalent to 66% of purchased goods & services and capital goods emissions for approximately 52 suppliers).

Achieving these goals involves, among many other measures: - An exhaustive analysis of the opportunities to continue working with suppliers and together reduce the carbon footprint. In 2019 and 2020, the suppliers with the largest carbon footprint have been identified and we will work with them to improve reporting channels and to seek alignment to reduce emissions in the value chain. - Continuing to contract green energy and reinforcing energy efficiency in the hotels.

Natural gas value-chain based approach. It has been developed to give answer to CDP requirements and concerns of various interest groups, as well as in an effort of awareness and transparency.  Following the first approach, this category has been considered not applicable to Enagás as our activity is limited to the transportation of natural gas, classified within the midstream segment. Enagás is not the owner of the gas at any stage of the value chain and therefore does not sell gas or any other product and it is not responsible for emissions related to the use of the products, the final end life of the product or its processing. This product sales activity corresponds to companies belonging to the distribution segment (downstream).

Whether we are deploying AFVs, optimizing distribution networks, or operating energy-efficient warehouses and service shops, Ryder helps customer reduce emissions and drive long-term value for their businesses.   After meeting our 2020 goal early to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 20% over a 2009 baseline, we recently implemented new targets to drive our strategy over the next three years while we finalize our longer term targets. To develop our new emissions targets, we closely tracked and evaluated materials factors that influence our emissions across the value chain. We identified priorities that present the greatest opportunity to reduce emissions and close existing data gaps while evaluating the resources available (and needed) to achieve our goals. Our new goals, which have been reviewed by the Board of Directors, aim to complete the following: - Reduce Scope 1 emissions (company-operated fleet) 10% by 2024, over 2018 baseline; - Reduce Scope 2 emissions (company-operated facilities) 30% by 2024, over 2018 baseline; and, - Reduce Scope 3 emissions (downstream leased equipment) 15% by 2024, over 2018 baseline.  As of 2020, Ryder Scope 3 emissions are tracked and reported under nine of the 15 categories. While we calculate and track emissions across more categories, Scope 3 emissions reported in this section include only those from downstream leased assets (Category 13), as they represent the highest percentage of our Scope 3 (and total emissions) and are the focus of our newest emission reduction target.

The Elk Hills Field is California’s largest in-state supplier of natural gas, providing nearly half of California’s natural gas production. The 550-megawatt Elk Hills Power Plant generates electricity from local natural gas to power the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields and supply enough electricity to a local utility and California’s electric grid to power up to 350,000 homes. The reliable electricity supply from the Elk Hills Power Plant has enabled CRC to operate the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields with electric-powered equipment that increases energy efficiency and reduces air emissions. CRC’s 2030 Carbon Sustainability Goal aims to make Elk Hills a model of long-term carbon capture and storage. CRC has a dedicated Enhanced Oil Recovery team that is designing a system to collect CO2 from the Elk Hills Power Plant and inject it into underground oil and natural gas formations at Elk Hills for enhanced oil recovery and long-term carbon sequestration. Several oil and gas formations at Elk Hills have already been identified as strong candidates for CO2 enhanced oil recovery.

One of the main impacts is associated with the construction of power plants and transmission and distribution lines, which in many cases requires vegetal suppression and can change the local landscape, flora and fauna. In these processes, we carefully conduct all requirements applicable to environmental licensing, minimizing impacts and adequately compensating them. The network layout, for example, is defined considering the least possible impact on isolated forests and trees. In sections where it is not possible to change the location of the towers and wires, we raise the height of the structures to avoid interaction with the local vegetation. One important initiative we have developed in the São Paulo state is the Preserva (""Preservation"") Program, an agreement with CETESB that allows us to unify the terms of an environmental recovery commitment and to carry interest. In this way, trees are planted in concentrated areas, enhancing the effect of habitat preservation and combating climate change. In addition, this enables a cost reduction of around R$ 224,000 per year.

This solution permits the replacement of trees that are incompatible with the transmission networks with shrub species that grow to smaller sizes and, at the same time, maintain the environmental quality of the areas where the assets are installed.

For Metsä Board, the content of the target Abs3 equals the target Abs2 (approved by the SBTi) in all other terms, but in Abs3 the base year is 2018 instead of 2016.     Metsä Board's target is that fossil CO2 emissions (scopes 1+2) will be zero by the end of 2030 compared to the base year 2018.   To achieve -100% absolute scope 1+2 emission reductions Metsä Board has a roadmap to 2030 including investments and adjustments that will be made at every mill. These actions will enable the switch from fossil fuels to bio-based fuels, electrifying some of the processes which currently use fossil-based natural gas, and improvement of energy-efficiency of the mills. The biggest investments will be made at Husum mill, including renewal of recovery boiler and turbine of the pulp mill as well as renewal of the fibre line. In addition to own energy production at MB's mills, all purchased energy will be based on fossil free energy sources by the end of 2030. This requires reconsideration of the current energy purchasing contracts. Target for MB's energy efficiency improvement is >10% between 2018-2030, which helps in reducing GHG emissions. Furthermore, MB's target to reduce process water use by 30% per product tonne in 2018-2030 supports the GHG reduction targets, because thanks to reduction in the water use, less energy is needed  for pumping and heating of the process water, and less energy is needed in the waste water treatment plant (because the water volume will be smaller). All this helps to cut CO2 emissions.  Metsä Board has also joined the Finnish energy efficiency agreement in 2017. In the energy efficiency agreement Metsä Board has committed to improve its energy efficiency by 7% from year 2017 to 2025.

ISO50001 energy management certification through the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) was achieved during the year by the cross-functional Energy Team. This was the first certification in the company and provides a basis for continued necessary progress, given the target to achieve 50% energy efficiency improvement by 2030. A fleet telematics system was introduced across the service fleet during the year, promoting fuel efficient driving behaviours. Thirty new vehicles were added to the fleet in 2020, with the NTA policy to cease purchasing diesel-only urban vehicles, the first tranche of 26 hybrid double deck buses were delivered at the end of 2020. A further 35 plug-in hybrid double deck buses is expected to arrive at the end of 2021. These are expected to reduce bus related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%. This is the first step in the transformation of the bus fleet from diesel engines to electric and fuel cell electric power. The plug-in hybrid vehicles being added to the fleet are a stepping stone towards a fully electric fleet. This will also require the transformation of depot facilities to ensure effective charging and maintenance of the new fleet. The NTA have ordered 40 single-deck battery electric buses to be delivered early in 2022, with at least 11 going to Bus Éireann to go into service in Athlone town. Following this approximately 35-40 full battery electric buses are expected to be delivered each year, which will allow Bus Éireann to reach 30% zero emission vehicles by 2025. At the end of 2020, 55% of the Bus Éireann service fleet are now at the cleaner Euro VI engine emissions standard. This figure will improve further with the planned arrival of additional Expressway and local service fleet in the coming year.

Ericsson’s goal is to continue to reduce carbon emissions per kilometer which can be achieved by using its vehicles in a more efficient way, for example, by trialing alternative fuels and implementing a global Fleet Management Solution including both Fleet Management (database) and Telematics (GPS data). In order to manage the fleet globally and drive CO2 footprint reduction initiatives, a system by which to measure is required.   Ericsson has used a variety of Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) over the past years including manual management on spreadsheets, leasing company and other 3rd party solutions and most recently an Ericsson internal system was used. In Q4-2019 it was determined that the internal system was unable to meet the full spectrum of requirements for global Fleet Management including Telematics so an internal team was formed to vet market solutions for a Fleet Management Solution which would be robust yet flexible enough to meet the global fleet management needs.    Market Area North America has a 3rd party solution provided by the leasing company which allows tracking of vehicles, fuel costs and CO2 emissions. At the end of 2019 they had 893 vehicles in the fleet which is approximately 14% of the Ericsson global fleet in cars, corresponding to 41% of the Ericsson fleet emissions.   Ericsson knows that better fleet management will allow them to increase access to data at management level, execute better operations, improve work-force management decisions and increase sustainability. A global Fleet Management Solution will allow Ericsson to more easily report and manage financial compliance, drive safety initiatives and reduce fleet CO2 emissions.

To achieve this target, WM continues to transition to alternative fuels and implement other fleet efficiency measures. WM has invested over $1B in natural gas transportation and innovation in the last two decades, and we have grown our fleet to 6,630 trucks, operating the largest private fleet of heavy duty natural gas trucks in the nation. For every diesel truck we replace with natural gas we reduce our use of diesel fuel by an average of 8,000 gallons per year along with a reduction of 14 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year (the equivalent of a 15 percent emissions reduction per truck). Our vehicles powered by CNG emit nearly zero particulate emissions, cut greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent, and are quieter than diesel trucks.   We innovate in collection logistics to reduce emissions by eliminating trips all together: Our Single Stream recycling facilities collect commingled source-separated recyclables in one truck for processing in facilities operated to minimize the potential for air releases.

This 2023 target for reduction of our own emissions has been set in accordance with the methodology set out by the Science Based Targets initiative. Moreover, we are currently in the process of calibrating this target and working towards having an updated target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in the near future.  Scope 1 entails our direct CO2 emissions from heating produced by oil and gas, as well as transportation in company cars. In the calculations of Scope 2, we include CO2 emissions stemming from electricity and heating production purchased from external suppliers. Scope 3 encompasses the CO2 emissions produced by paper consumption, air transportation and use of employees' own cars for activities related to company operations.  In 2020, our operations resulted in 7,871 tonnes of CO2 emissions, which is a 48% decrease from 2019 ((7871-14868)/14868)*100). Since the significant decrease in CO2 emissions is mainly caused by the corona pandemic, and we expect consumption figures to increase again as employees return to pre-pandemic routines, our current 2023 target will be maintained without change.

2227,308,"Since the early 2000s the Group’s three airports on the French Riviera have been committed to a voluntary and ambitious initiative to reduce their carbon footprint; they have now set themselves a new challenge: to reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2030 and to switch from offsetting their own residual emissions to removal - of not only all their own emissions, but also in part those of the planes landing at their airports. As a result, on the 15 January 2020, the Aéroports de la Côte d'Azur Group announced, 20 years ahead of its original schedule, its commitment to no longer emit a single gram of CO2 at any of its three airports. This unique pairing of the environment and the future is based on a clearly defined agenda which, with each action, and as technical opportunities become available, will be openly released to the public.  In practical terms, the Group’s three airports, following their own schedule and according to their own specific-characteristics, will implement various solutions to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, develop the production of solar-powered energy, support the emergence of new fuel sources or even create on-site carbon sinks to capture residual emissions or aircraft emissions.  This commitment is highlighted by the Group in achieving the most stringent 3+ level certification of the independent Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, in 2016 for Nice, and in 2018 for the entire Group, thus becoming the first carbon-neutral airport group in France. This accreditation recognised efforts taken to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions directly attributable to airport management activities: emissions from buildings, ground equipment, vehicles, employees, etc.  This is why, in 2019, independent calculations at Nice Côte d’Azur Airport estimated the volume of greenhouse gas emissions per passenger passing thorough the Nice terminals at around 71 grams of CO2 equivalent. This volume is four times lower than in 2012, despite the number of plane movements increasing by 3% over the same period. The Group aims to achieve the level 4 and 4+ by 2030.

The rise in carbon emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) for the vehicle fleet is 9% (to 64245 tonnes). The main driver in both cases is the strong volume growth in the parcel business (+18%) supported by Austrian Post’s partner-ship with Deutsche Post DHL Group. Austrian Post added the delivery of Deutsche Post DHL Group parcels to private individuals in Austria to its own existing logistics network in August 2019. This integration and the increase in volume required expansion of capacity in the logistics centres as well as in transport and vehicles. On the whole, the discontinuation of DHL’s own delivery network effects an increase in efficiency in delivery throughout Austria and thus an improvement in the energy and environ-mental balance. Austrian Post will work on a revision of the SBT in 2021 with 2020 as a new base year (first year of full data with DHL Group integration), in order to consider the new market trends in the scenario analysis.

The rise in carbon emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) for the vehicle fleet is 15 % (to 73,633 tonnes).  Both figures were driven by the strong growth in parcel volumes (+30 %) brought about by Austrian Post’s partnership with Deutsche Post DHL Group and significant organic growth, which in turn was spurred by lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This partnership and the increase in volumes made it necessary for Austrian Post to increase the capacity of its logistics centres, as well as its transport and vehicle capacities. On the whole, the discontinuation of DHL’s own delivery network effects an increase in efficiency in delivery throughout Austria and thus an improvement in the energy and environmental balance.  Austrian Post is currently working on a revision of the current SBT with 2020 as a new base year (first year of full data with DHL Group integration), in order to consider the new market trends in the scenario analysis.

In December 2017, Mainstreams 140MW Khobab Wind Farm was commissioned and began generating clean renewable energy. This led to the displacement of 38,340.1 tCO2e in one month of operation. This figure represents 3.8% of our total gross Scope 1 emissions for 2017.  This project will continue displacing CO2 emissions for the whole of its 25+ year lifetime We forecast a continued reduction in our emissions intensity. As we are a pure play renewawble energy developer, we intend to continue doisplacing traditional electricity generation, and thus displacing the GHG emmissions associated with these traditional geenerators.  We intend on reducing our scope 2 and 3 emissions mainly through reducing the amount of electricity imported by each off our operational sites. This shall include the development of an emissions target in 2018 and aim to reduce our Scope 2 and 3 emissions intensity as we continue to grow. We are a pure-play renewable energy developer and as such, our scope 1 emissions are negative, and our scope 2 and 3 emissions represent less than 1% of our net emissions. As such, setting an intensity target is not useful. It is more beneficial to us to set a renewable production target. Our goal is to lead the electrification of developing countries through the introduction of renewable clean energy. Therefore, year on year, as we develop more projects, our Scope 1 emissions drop further. Our aim is to reduce our emissions intensity over the next five years and further as we target our relatively small Scope 2 and 3 emissions at each operational wind and solar farm. We aim to achieve this by reducing the electricity imported by each of our operational sites, and through sourcing renewable electricity sources for each of our offices as renewables grow in their respective countries. We have achieved this in our Dublin office, where 100% of our electricity needs are emt by renewable sources.

This target is part of Landsvirkjun's goal to become carbon neutral in 2025, our action plan to achieve this target for 2030 is therefore structured to accomplish most of the emission reduction as early as in 2025.  We have prepared an action plan to achieve our target to become carbon neutral, based on comprehensive data on the Company’s carbon footprint. We have strategically prioritized the most efficient way to achieve carbon neutrality and in what order: 1. Prevent new emissions – 2. Reduce current emissions – 3. Implement mitigation measures. Landsvirkjun's internal carbon price is adjusted annually to provide the best incentives for Landsvirkjun to achieve its objective of carbon neutrality in 2025.   In order to reduce Scope 1 emissions by 50% in our target year, the following measures need be taken.  (1) Reduce emissions from our Geothermal Power generation by 60%  by the year 2026 compared to our base year. This will be achieved  by cleaning the carbon dioxide emitted from geothermal gas and re-injecting it back into the geothermal system. Landsvirkjun has been engaged in R&D activities on geothermal gas sequestration and utilization since 2012. A specific R&D project on developing CO2 capture and sequestration in Krafla was initiated in 2019. The activities and R&D investment in the project are expected to increase substantially during the next few years. The ongoing R&D work is foreseen to lead to a pilot CO2 capture and sequestration operation in the next 1-3 years and a start up of a commercial scale unit in the year 2025. (2) Reduce fossil fuel emissions by 99%. We can achieve this by increasing the number of clean energy vehicles (electric, hydrogen, etc) and by using sustainable biofuel for our more specialized vehicles, if the technology to replace them isn't available.   Similar target for long-term (more than 15 years) has not yet been set by Landsvirkjun. Landsvirkjun's carbon intensity in the year 2019 is 3.9 g CO2-eq/kWh (2016: 4.1 g CO2-eq/kWh, 2017:4.4 g CO2-eq/kWh,  2018: 4.2 g CO2-eq/kWh).

In FY 2019, we began a multi-year, multi-site project to install enclosures and emission control systems on our shredders to improve air quality in the communities surrounding our shredders. We have to installed such emission control systems at one facility Massachusetts, with development underway for a facility in California, and planning underway for facilities in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Some of these new projects will include installation of thermal oxidizers to treat volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOC treatment protects air quality by both reducing the potential for ozone formation and significantly decreasing GHG emissions. We have taken a leadership position within the metal shredding industry by properly quantifying air emissions associated with shredding operations and taking appropriate steps to reduce such emissions. Utilizing the Transition Pathway Initiative's (TPI) assessment of the Carbon Performance of steel makers (updated version published January 2021), we consider our target to be a science-based target as our current carbon intensity (scope 1+2) per metric ton of finished steel product produced was approximately 0.18 in FY 2020, well below the Below 2 Degree scenario of approximately 1.15 for 2025, and we have near-term intentions to have it submitted for review and approval by the  SBTi.",11,0.3757854,"Replace Coal Plants with Natural Gas, Solar and Wind Powered Systems"
3000,2892,"This target covers: Direct GHG emissions (scope 1): GHG emissions from the consumption of coal, oil, gas and biomass in SSE’s thermal generation plant (including Power Purchase Agreements) to generate electricity, gas consumption in buildings, network and company vehicle fuel (petrol, diesel or gas oil) consumed and fugitive emissions (use of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in the transmission and distribution networks for conductivity (used in the switchgears and substations)); and Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2): GHG emissions from electricity consumption in buildings, networks and thermal power stations as well as distribution losses (this is the electricity lost in SSE’s distribution network in the north of Scotland (SHEPD) and southern central England (SEPD) transporting electricity to the customer).  Performance against the target: SSE’s target is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, based on 2018 levels. In comparison to the baseline year of 2017/18, SSE’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions fell by nearly 20%. The main contributing factors to this decrease included: • Emissions from electricity generation activities: these emissions fell as a direct result of the decarbonisation of the fuels used to generate electricity. • Emissions from SSE’s electricity and gas consumption: SSE’s buildings and operations used less gas and electricity in comparison to the previous year as a result of continued investments in energy efficiency measures combined with lower output from thermal power station assets.  It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2030 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather-related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2030 target and the long-term trend continues to be significant reduction in the absolute emissions from the electricity it generates.  This target covers SSE’s scope 1 and 2 emissions and is a science-based target, validated by the SBTi.

3002,3951,"The design and permit of the CalCapture carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) system at Elk Hills by 2030 would, if permitted, funded and installed, reduce CRC’s statewide GHG emissions by 30% below our 2013 baseline, reduce the carbon intensity of the project’s oil by 50%, and put the Elk Hills Power Plant on a path to serve as a carbon neutral source of base-load electricity for California. This goal involves a significant multi-year effort to design a complex and integrated CCS system with a capacity to achieve the absolute reduction target. Installation of the system and achieving the desired GHG reduction would be subject to the company’s liquidity and its VCI investment threshold, as well as securing funding commitments and permits. The Elk Hills Field is California’s largest in-state supplier of natural gas, providing over half of California’s in-state natural gas production. The 550-MW Elk Hills Power Plant generates electricity from local natural gas to power the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields and supply enough surplus electricity to a local utility and California’s electric grid, increasing energy efficiency and reducing air emissions. CRC’s 2030 Carbon Sustainability Goal aims to make Elk Hills a model of long-term CCS that can be applied in other oil and gas formations at Elk Hills and other fields CRC operates. CRC has a dedicated Enhanced Oil Recovery and CCS team that is designing the CalCapture system to collect CO2 from the Elk Hills Power Plant and inject it into underground oil and natural gas formations at Elk Hills for enhanced oil recovery and long-term carbon sequestration. A Front-End Engineering Design Study is being conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute and Fluor Corporation. The Study was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy in 2019 to receive financial support, and the study is fully funded and scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Several oil and gas formations at Elk Hills have already been identified as strong candidates for CO2 enhanced oil recovery. Under this process, the CO2 sweeps oil from the pore space in the formation to producing wells, permanently trapping a significant quantity of the injected CO2 in the pore space. At the surface, the remaining CO2 is separated from the oil and recycled for injection in a closed loop, supplemented by additional CO2 from the power plant.",11,0.368266,"Replace Coal Plants with Natural Gas, Solar and Wind Powered Systems"

This transforming, from using fossil fuel as main energy source, also included a transformation into using electricity from the grid as energy source. In order to make sure that the transformation from fossil fuel was made into fossil free electricity, Holmen’s Group management made a decision to purchase 100 % fossil free electricity from the grid.

The absolute target Abs1 for the BMW Group production network is a major, joining the RE100 initiative of the Climate Group at the COP21 in Paris and commit to purchase 100 % renewable electricity in the future a further step to achieve the target Abs2 (for details of our renewable energy target within the RE100 initiative please see C4.2). Since Abs1 as well as the renewable energy target in C4.2 are interim targets to achieve Abs2, measures in 2017 are the same as described there.  Procedure: On the way to 100% renewable energy supply of our locations BMW Group takes a holistic approach. Top priority is given to systematic reduction of energy consumption, as energy savings are always the best alternative, both for the environment and for our business. To cover the remaining energy requirements, we are expanding our own renewable energy generation systems and are increasingly drawing power from local renewable sources. The renewable energy target in C4.2  addresses only CO2-emissions from purchased electricity. Abs1 includes also emissions from heat supply as well as from fuel combustion inside the BMW Group. On a mid to long-term perspective we see the potential to replace in an economically reasonable way fossil fuels by renewable fuels (e.g. biogas) and are doing this e.g. in Spartanburg (USA) with landfill gas.   Scope of target: The emissions in Scope include all BMW Group locations including the Joint Venture locations in China. It excludes emissions from company owned vehicles and airplanes. From the 2015 emissions figures we get as percentage of emissions in scope 94%.  Remark: To calculate the % of emissions in scope we included in the denominator emissions from company owned cars and planes since these are BMW Group Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions. In the method as outlined by the technical paper “SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION APPROACH (SDA): A method for setting corporate emission reduction targets in line with climate science” of the Science Based Targets Initiative these two categories belong however to other industry sectors.

The main emissions reduction levers are: - the development of CCS in partnership with other players: this is the action with the greatest impact in terms of CO2 savings, but the cost of these solutions is an obstacle. Therefore, the ambition is to develop a pilot and identify the least capital-intensive technologies; - using bio-reducers in ore reduction: the issue of this action is the ability to access sustainably managed bio- reducers compatible with the constraints of our processes ; - replacing heavy fuel oil by gas for the production of electricity - the establishment of renewable electricity purchases and production coupled with the electrification of mines: at the same time as developing technical solutions, the successful implementation of this lever is based on a radical change of culture which requires long-term support; - developing the pre reduction of hydrogen ore alongside bio-reducers.  Moreover, three decarbonation scenarios have been built: - absolute potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation without considering any other constraints - technical potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account what is technically feasible - actionable potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account both technical and economic constraints. this is this later scenario that has been used to build the decarbonation roadmap  This robust roadmap to reduce the carbon footprint of Eramet's activities includes the percentage of activation of the different emissions reduction levers, a timeline (2025, 2030, 2035) and the impact and activation of the levers are at the granularity of the site to be easily actionable and precise.

Following the publication of IPCC's SR15 Report, in 2019 we have submitted a new target that was validated by the SBTi, with an increased ambition to achieve -100% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, and a -35% emissions from scope 3 within the same period, in line with 1.5°C required levels of ambition. During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our carbon footprint for all scopes in particular by: - including emissions from our company fleet in scope 1 (previously reported but in scope 3) - estimating scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites out of our environmental reporting scope (the scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001 certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All of the industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and the major tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations: - the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed - the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target).

This new carbon reduction commitment brings us one step further in our long-term journey towards a low-carbon business model, addressing our global impacts and contributing to the 2° scenario confirmed by the Paris Agreement. The alignment with a 2°C scenario has been checked with SDA method.  We commit to reduce our absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 25% by 2030, from a 2016 base year. In support of this goal, we will reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions at our operated sites 100% by 2025, from a 2016 base year. We will prioritize our actions by focusing on our most significant sources of Scope 3 emissions, i.e. use of sold products, purchased goods and services, upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, end of life of sold products, business travel. To do so, a global roadmap has been set at Group level, and declined within the contributing departments.  In 2018, we started to put our SBT commitments into practice. In this framework, a new Green Move ambition, which covers the reduction of the environmental footprint of mobility aspects (business travels, car fleet and daily commute), has been set up. On business travel, reducing the environmental footprint of travels by plane is a key topic and involves several levers such as assessing the travel’s carbon footprint from employees of all the subsidiaries with a shared Group’s methodology or promoting IT-solutions as alternatives to business travels. Achieving this Group target relies on a global awareness of all the employees on the importance of the issue, as well as on an individual awareness. For individual awareness, employees having travelled at least once in the past three months now receive a personalized quarterly dashboard with their cumulated CO2 emissions.  The percentage of target achieved (0%) at the end of 2018 is mainly explained by the Group’s growth between 2016, which is the base-year of our SBT commitment, and 2018. Indeed, while Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions decreased by 26% between 2016 and 2018, the growth of the activities contributes during the same period of time to increase the Group’s Scope 3 emissions by 5%.

However in 2020 (reporting year) we now have 'Purchased Heating and Cooling' emissions to account for within Scope 2. The emissions from 'Purchased Heating and Cooling' equate to 199.68 tonnes CO2e and are now included in the same scope as our original target, reducing our performance against target to 97.3% achieved, despite achieving our switch to 100% renewable electricity two years early in 2018.

Our targets at present are focussed around use of renewable electricity as shown in Low Consumption targets. This will in turn reduce our scope 2 emissions which make up around 96% of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as a large proportion of our Scope 3 emissions. We are currently reviewing our sustainability strategy and the related emissions targets with a view to next year, implementing a 'Net Zero' target across the entire of our own operations and some of our value chain partner operations.

Kiwi Property signed up to the Science Based Organisation and set Science Based Targets in 2016.  The targets were revised in 2019, to align with IPCC and Science Based Organisation recommendations for achieving an under a 1.5o C temperature increase  Kiwi Property set its targets based on the Absolute-based approach  with a year-on-year reduction of 4.2% from the 2012 base year, achieving a 54% reduction by 2030 and 80 % reduction by 2050.  Our carbon targets includes all Scopes (1, 2 and 3) emissions and uses market based electricity reporting.    To date our targets have been achieved as a result of Kiwi Property’s strong energy efficiency programme.  Since 2012 Kiwi Property has reduced its Scope 1 emissions by 30%, Scope 2 by 50% and its Scope 3 emissions by 62%.  Overall Kiwi Property’s carbon programme has reduced emissions from 6,834tCO2e to 3,176 tCO2e a reduction of 3,658 tCO2e.  We have recently revised our targets, we are now targeting carbon neutral by 2030.  This is a significantly more onerous target than previous.  Kiwi Property has a protocol, in accordance with the GHG Protocol, for comparing like-for-like, that previous years carbon emissions and the base year will be recalculated when a new or sold asset represents greater than 5% of the total carbon footprint.  In addition, the new asset’s carbon footprint can only be included if the asset had been in operation for the year in question.  In 2018, Kiwi Property sold two buildings, both exceeded the 5% threshold and were in the portfolio since the base year.  This required the base year and subsequent years to be recalculated, removing the emissions from the two buildings.  This ensures comparability of performance of the assets within Kiwi Property’s boundary.

4205,4566,"In 2010, the world’s governments agreed to work towards holding the average global temperature rise to below 2°C, a level deemed likely to prevent the worst effects of climate change. This threshold implies a ‘carbon budget’ – a total volume of greenhouse gases that can be emitted while still providing a degree of confidence that the 2°C target can be met. According to figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this requires a 41- 72% reduction of global emissions by 2050. Based upon its analysis of the feasibility study summarized above, ADM has set an ambitious goal to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from its 2019 baseline by 2035. This represents an annual reduction of 1.67% for 15 years. This is more aggressive than the absolute emissions contraction approach that takes into account the global carbon budget, which requires an annual reduction of 1.23% to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius.  WSP and ADM have developed a plan with sufficient reductions to reach a GHG reduction target of 25% over 15 years. The projects selected to achieve the reductions include purchasing renewable electricity, increasing use of biomass fuels, transportation fleet changes, and in some locations, equipment changes. • Renewable energy and biofuels – Through the purchase of renewable electricity, ADM can significantly reduce its Scope 2 emissions. Increasing the amount of biofuels burned onsite will reduce Scope 1 emissions. ADM is moving forward with several projects to use biodiesel in its fleet of boats and trucks. • Fuel switching – In both stationary and mobile equipment, ADM has opportunities to switch to less carbon-intense fuels. Some facilities can feasibly switch to natural gas or cofire biomass in the boilers. ADM is also assessing the use of liquefied natural gas for its boat fleet and compressed natural gas for its truck fleet in certain geographies. • Energy treasure hunts – ADM has had success over the past few years conducting energy treasure hunts which identify energy efficiency and reduction opportunities across its facilities globally. Although sufficient reduction projects have been identified to achieve the 25% reduction target, as ADM implements these projects over the next 15 years, new technologies may become available that offer greater or less costly reduction opportunities.

4361,5573,"This absolute Scope 3 target to reduce Ball's GHGs 16% against a 2017 baseline is part of its approved SBTs.   This increase was anticipated because Ball updated its calculation approach to purchased metals to better align with its customers. Different methodologies exist for calculating the embedded GHG emissions of materials such as aluminum. The main difference stems from how recycling credits are being allocated for the material: 1.) A material can get the full credit for avoided emissions by only considering the amount of recycled material used when producing the material (called recycled content, cut-off, or 100:0 allocation). 2.) Or, one can argue that products – like fast moving consumer goods – should get a credit for their real end-of-life recycling rate because only a product that is recyclable and actually recycled creates environmental benefits by replacing the need for more resource and energy intensive production of virgin materials (called end-of-life recycling, substitution, or 0:100 allocation). There is no scientific consensus around which methodology is most appropriate when calculating embedded GHG emissions. Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased metals published by Ball prior to 2020 were based on the 20:80 method and relied on industry average recycled content values published by regional aluminum trade associations, and recycling rates published by governments and – where not available - estimates based on research conducted by Ball and its partners. In 2020 Ball used the 100:0 approach because Ball has primary data (supplier-specific recycled content values) which will  more accurately account for our GHG footprint from purchased metals. Average emission factors for primary aluminum and steel are calculated by adjusting the average grid mix impact. If no specific emissions factor exists for specified tons of purchased metal from a supplier/country/site/metal, then a default figure for that country is used.   Ball updated its 2017 baseline Scope 3 data to the 100:0 approach for internal SBT tracking purposes, but Ball has not yet submitted this revision to the SBTi for approval. Companies re-baseline and re-submit their SBT data every 5 years.

The main initiatives required to meet the target in Nordic are: •   Scope 1 emissions: These emissions are mainly from fuel consumption from company car fleet. To eliminate these, we must reach a close to 100% electric car fleet by 2030. •   Scope 2 emissions: These emissions are from our electricity consumption. To eliminate these, we will  ensure that all electricity is from renewable sources through a mix of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and Guarantees of Origin. •   Both scopes: Energy efficiency measures in network operations  The main initiatives required to meet the target in Asia are: • Scope 1 emissions:  Replace diesel usage with solar or wind solutions at off-grid and bad-grid base stations • Scope 2 emissions: Ensure that the majority of purchased grid electricity in the region electricity is from certified renewable sources either through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and/or through I-RECs.

Our overall energy usage from base year to target year is expected to increase, so this target is expected to result in an equivalent annual reduction of emissions from base year to target year of 124% by 2025, though we have written 100% as that is the maximum value possible for this field. Our % reduction from base year represents annual emissions reductions in our target year due to additional purchases of renewables (1.8 million tCO2), as compared to our annual base year emissions covered by this target (1.5 million tCO2). [(1.8 million tCO2/1.5 million tCO2)*100 = 124%].

This approach is justified, since 94% of CO2 emissions from scopes 1 and 2 are due to energy consumption in its sites, with the rest due to leakage of refrigerant fluids. Another area of action is the search for alternatives to fossil fuels. Since 2009, we have managed to improve the energy efficiency of our industrial sites by 25% (from 11.0 to 8.2 GJ/t) and at the same time, we have increased the share of renewable energy by 28 points, allowing the Group to reduce its GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2 by 16% between 2009 and 2021. So, we've met and exceeded our 2021 goal. It should be noted that more than half of the Group’s emissions are attributable to MANE plants in Ohio State (32% of total emissions in absolute terms) and Indonesia (20%), while these sites alone account for only 26% of total tonnage shipped. In both countries, electricity emission factors are also much higher than in France (about 10 times more), with electricity production mainly from fossil fuels.

4912,6079,"Alfa Laval's carbon emissions target is to reduce carbon emissions by 15% between 2015 and 2020.  The target reported in our Sustainability Report 2019 refers primarily to energy consumption within and outside the organization: emissions in 2015 = 76,777 tonnes CO2e emissions in 2019 = 37,911 tonnes CO2e -> 51% decrease  However, in this question we apply a broader approach to our carbon emissions and disclose emissions in Scope 1+Scope 2 (market-based)+Scope 3. Scope 1 includes energy consumption within the organization and company cars. Scope 2 includes direct emissions (market-based method) and Scope 3 includes goods transportation, business travel (air travel and rental cars). The base year and the year the target was set is 2015 and the strategy period is 2016–2020:  emissions in 2015 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 155,093 tonnes CO2e emissions in 2019 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 120,912 tonnes CO2e -> 22% decrease since the base year.  The base year emissions figure was revised due to organizational changes and a transition to a new reporting and data management system.  To ensure Alfa Laval achieves its carbon emission target, we work to increase the proportion of renewable electricity used. In 2019, 73% of Alfa Laval’s electricity was sourced from renewable sources, compared with 27% in 2015. During the year, we further increased the share of power purchase agreements in our global electricity supply. We focused on sites where electricity was generated from coal or other fossil fuels. In 2019, six of our large operation sites in China and India began to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources.   However, our carbon emissions from goods transport remain high due to greater transport need and more air freight compared to sea freight. In 2019, emissions from goods transportation amounted to 50,123 tonnes of CO2e, a 19% decrease from 2018 but a 9% increase compared to the baseline 2015.

We consider this a science-based target and in 2021 SKF signed up to the SBTI 1.5 degree commitment so  this and all other relevant targets will be verified by SBTI.  Defining targets which meet the SBTI requirements for scope 1 and 2 emissions and upstream Scope 3  is relatively simple. . Down-stream he Scope 3 emissions resulting from customer use of our products is more challenging  SKF can significantly reduce direct customer emissions in a number of ways such as; • providing products, solutions which help to enable cleantech industries such as renewable energy  • optimizing SKF products and / or customer systems – providing lower weight or lower friction SKF products or helping the customer to design more energy and carbon efficient systems.  • applying Rotating Equipment Performance contracts that avoid energy and carbon waste.  From (LCA) and Carbon Footprint studies on our products and solutions over the years and from these we know that the ghg reductions achieved with these approaches are typically many times greater than  our own operations and upstream.  However, to quantify and aggregate these savings as well as the emissions associated with the normal running our products across more than 40 globalized industries in a meaningful way is extremely challenging. This is due to the nature of the SKF product offering and our position in the value chain. The same SKF product can typically be applied in multiple different applications. Each application has potentially very different energy use and associated greenhouse gas impacts.On top of this, a large percentage of SKF’s products are sold via our globalized distributor network – and very often it is not possible for us to know where the product is applied (which customer, which industry).

We had to remove non relevant sales and products categories with too diverse products to carry out the assessment. As a result consolidated products in the GHG assessment of the Group represent 94% of sales quantity and 98% of sales in euros. Aware of the importance of the energy issue, and wishing to continue to stay ahead of changes in the regulations, in 2015, the Group decided to ramp up its coordination of these types of initiatives. The Smart Energy Products project was created.the first stage consisted of identifying the product families with the greatest impact in terms of energy consumption, given their individual consumption and the volumes sold, in order to concentrate the project’s efforts on them. In 2016, the Group defined a standard method for calculating consumption and energy efficiency for each of these families, and one or two standard products that will be used as a reference for measuring progress. The new calculation method was applied to all the products developed over the year. At the same time, the Group is continuing its research work, particularly on new motor technologies. These efforts are reflected in the new generations of products released on the market: the Moveling hairdryer (Rowenta/Calor), launched in 2016, consumes 20% less energy to achieve the same performance, i.e. 1,700 watts instead of 2,100 watts for the reference model. Consumers are informed of this progress by the phrase “Performance 2,100 Effiwatts is equivalent to 2,100 W product at only 1,700 W energy consumption” in the products’ communication materials. Another example : All the ranges of our vacuum cleaners launched in 2017 are 60% to 70% more energy efficient than the 2014 ranges. To achieve this level of performance, the Group developed low input/high output motors, designed more effective suction nozzles and improved all the air flows to reduce charge losses.",34,0.5389747,Energy Efficiency in Sold Products
5135,5042,"The significant decrease in 2020 also partly reflects reduced sales volumes on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.  With its scope 3 target, Bosch has deliberately set itself a very ambitious goal as upstream and downstream emissions. In addition, the target value was set independently of sales growth, which means the mitigation target will increase steadily as the company grows in the future. There are also a large number of external factors Bosch can only influence indirectly, such as suppliers’ success reducing CO2 emissions.   We are pursuing a three-stage approach to make sure we achieve our goals. In a first step, in 2019 we analyzed all scope 3 categories in accordance with the GHG Protocol using external databases and then focused on those from which the majority (99 percent) of CO₂ emissions originate. According to the findings, upstream emissions in the Bosch value chain primarily concern purchased goods and services as well as logistics. Downstream emissions are mainly caused by the use of our products. However, it is not possible to measure a company’s specific progress based on database values. In 2020, we therefore went one step further and increased the calculation’s granularity for the main categories, while also integrating specific parameters into the models. This finer-grained calculation makes it possible, among other things, to identify significant drivers within purchasing and in the use of our products, based on which we can derive measures that make an active and measurable contribution to climate action. In this process, we focus primarily on options that lie within our immediate sphere of influence.  We are continuously refining our calculation methodology in order to obtain as realistic a picture as possible of our scope 3 emissions and thus meet our standards with respect to transparency and completeness.

First, we agreed that 2019 should be the base year as the most recent ""normal"" year, with limited impact from COVID. We considered a 5-year period to be preferable to a one year goal, particularly given the disruption caused by the COVID crisis. This is how we decided to have a 25% reduction between 2019 and 2025. Subsequently, we chose to have a third party to measure our full Scope 3 emissions, because thus far we had considered Scope 1 & 2 only and it was clear that our Scope 3 emissions were very likely too significant to be omitted.

The change in total emissions is really small, one could say that the emissions are flat (from 37831 tons to 38137, that means a change of 0,8%). Considering the fact that the factory in China has grown, and has increased production, then this small increase is an encouraging result, and is a reflection of the environmental impact reduction efforts in all the different sites.  Generally speaking, it appears that optimizing factories, changing their throughput, has a real impact on emissions, because bigger machines with better yields contribute to a smaller footprint.

5149,6431,"The second milestone ""Abs 4"" target is to reach Net Zero emissions across our third-party logistics (transportation) partner operations.   We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible. Emissions from our third-party logistics (transportation) partner operations have been calculated to account for 97% of our total Scope 3 (Category 4: Upstream Transportation & Distribution) emissions. We're working to identify what proportion of emissions in scope we'll need to meaningfully offset, but it is believed that we can achieve 70% through absolute reduction, due to: 1) Working to reduce the weight of our garments, which reduces the carbon emissions using the ""distance based"" method and associated ""tonne.km"" emission factors. To date, we've seen a >40% reduction in weight due to packaging removal, packaging alternatives, light-weighting packaging and better data collection 2) Our work on reducing our use of carbon intense logistics; notably reducing our use of air-freight. In 2021 our proportion of garments freighted by air was 62% lower than our base year. In addition we're also introducing lower carbon alternatives on some route such as river barges instead of road and intermodal (rail + sea) instead of road.  We've identified this as a bespoke milestone target due to: 1) These emissions are material to our full Scope 1-3 inventory (to our current knowledge) 2) We have greater ability to collect large volumes of high quality primary data in this category 3) We have a strong ability to influence change in this category due to relationships we hold with our partners 4) We've reviewed and aligned to wider industry and business ambitions, including  British Retail Consortium (BRC) Climate Roadmap, which set specific transportation Net Zero targets.  In order to ensure we have an accurate account of these indirect (Scope 3) emissions we'll be undertaking a full Scope 3 assessment and calculation within the next year.  From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5C trajectory. We intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required.

The calculation of our emission reduction targets is based on the core policy scenario EUCO30. Moreover, we assume an improvement of energy efficiency and gas pipelines leading to a reduction on Scope 1 emissions by 1% annually and a 1% reduction of transmission and distribution losses of Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions will be reduced by increasing the share of renewable energy purchased and increasing the share of own generation of electricity from renewable energy sources.  Under 2018 we released a new energy efficiency project: “All E.ON premises carbon-neutral by 2030”. We updated the target to 2030 in order to be in line with the SDG timeframe and our climate stratgey. Our direct and indirect carbon emissions totalled 79.40 million tonnes of CO2e in 2017, what represents a slight decline compared to previous year. This was mainly due to the lower Scope 3 emissions. Lower purchasing volumes, the purchase of less carbon-intensive materials and lower sales volumes of electricity and gas led to reductions.  2016 marked the starting point of measures and initiatives that will help us achieve our new climate-protection targets for 2030. However, year-on-year comparisons can be affected by fluctuations.

In the Imaging Products Business, whose main products are cameras and lenses, we will reduce GHG emissions by reducing the weight and size of our products. The Precision Equipment Division, whose main products are FPD lithography systems and semiconductor lithography systems, we will reduce the GHG emissions by improving the functions of parts through technological development, reducing the number of parts and downsizing parts. Furthermore, we reduce GHG emissions per part by instructing our suppliers to manufacture parts more efficiently. Regarding countermeasures in ""Upstream transportation & distribution"", in addition to promoting modal shift, we streamline the transportation route. We are also improving the loading efficiency of our cargo and reducing GHG emissions.  99% of the emissions of ""Use of sold products"" is the emissions from product use of the Precision Equipment Business. Approximately half of the power consumption of Precision Equipment Business products is due to exposure light source units. Therefore, we will develop an exposure light source unit with lower power consumption and reduce GHG emissions.  In FY 2020, GHG emissions from these three categories decreased significantly compared to the previous year. We analyze that this is due to the significant decrease in production by the pandemic of the COVID-19, and the shrinking camera market.

Performance against the target: SSE’s target is to reduce absolute GHG emissions from use of products sold by 50% by 2034 from a 2018 base year.

It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2034 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather-related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase.

During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our scope 3 carbon footprint in particular by estimating emissions from the use of our products, as our products consume electricity and dissipate heat (Joule effect) during use phase. Emissions from use phase were estimated to about 60,000,000 tCO2, representing over 84% of scope 3 emissions.  Nevertheless, our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations: -the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed -the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target). In addition, a vast majority of Schneider Electric’s products have long lifecycles, from up to 40 years. This directly translates into high use-phase emissions, compared to other industries with shorter-lifespan products, such as consumer electronics. Looking solely at use-phase induced absolute emission therefore generates a strong biais in the evaluation of the sustainability performance of offers, as companies producing durable products are penalized compared to other sectors. This is why, it is important to account for the emissions in the use phase of our products and engage in their reduction, but it is absolutely essential to underline the role that they are playing in the decarbonization of the economy. Schneider Electric has launched a major innovation in 2018: reporting externally quarterly (in our Schneider Sustainability Impact) how much CO2 our solutions enable our customers to save. Our ambition was to save 120 MTCO2 from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, we reported 51 Mt CO2 saved by our customers thanks to our products and we achieved to save 134 Mt CO2 end of 2020.

Offsetting operational emissions is not enough. We’re taking a bold position to leverage innovation and lead the industry in combating climate change. Landfill methane emissions, vehicle and equipment emissions, and building electricity all contribute to climate change. That’s why we’ve adopted an aggressive target for reducing our operational GHG emissions, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and aligned with the UN “Climate Action” SDG 13.2 - reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Goal: Reduce absolute total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030. Simply put, our ambitious target reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is designed to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C. However, the path we’ll take to achieve this goal is anything but simple. How We’ll Get There 1. Reducing Emissions Through Landfill Innovation Fugitive emissions are approximately 50% methane – a recognized greenhouse gas. Highly efficient landfills such as ours collect most of this gas for beneficial reuse or processing, turning an impact into an opportunity. However, to further manage our fugitive emissions and meet our goal, we’ll be looking at new technology and operating practices while ensuring that landfills remain stable and secure for decades to come. 2.

Toscana Energia was only consolidated for 3 months in 2019, hence the baseline is recalculated to reflect 12 months of Toscana Energia for 2019.

The target anticipated an increase in leak detection activity with an initial stable/higher emissions and a drop after, on the back of actions implemented The great majority of Italgas emissions are fugitive emissions originated from gas distribution while Scope 2 emissions are very small. Thanks to the digital transformation of the network and the technological innovations implemented in leak detection Italgas expects that by 2026 it will have reduced methane emissions by 20% as reported in its 2020-26 Strategic Plan and other emissions. As regards leak detection, in 2018, Italgas introduced and now makes extensive use of CRDS (Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy) technology developed by Picarro. It consists of a sophisticated sensing technology that, compared with traditional technologies, offers important advantages in terms of the speed of conduct and extent of areas under control. Relative to a regulatory requirement to inspect the whole network on a 3 to 4 years rolling basis, with Picarro, Italgas plans to inspect the whole network at least annually. Further Picarro can detect leaks with a sensitivity three times greater than that currently used by all other industry operators (parts per billion vs parts per million); identify a gas leak even a few dozen meters away from the route covered by the equipped vehicle thanks to specific on-board sensors and sophisticated calculation software. Thanks to this technology, Italgas is the only operator in Italy to carry out scheduled gas leakage detection, also extended to all the underground and overhead connections, albeit this activity is not prescribed by current legislation and regulations.

Additionally, GEB is committed to update the carbon foot print base year and advance in the definition of GHG emissions reductions targets that may be verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, where GEB has recently become part in 2015. Additionally, due to the implementation of the new corporate strategy launched at the end of 2016, the company opened new strategic business groups to work on low-emission generation with alternative and non-conventional energies, as well as a strategic group for urban energy solutions with a high innovation potential in Colombia. The group has high expectations regarding the results of its incursion in this field for the upcoming years. This new operation will have a positive impact on GEB’s carbon management and will be integrated into the achievement of national goals associated with GHG reduction of 20% by 2030, which was adopted by the Colombian Government in Conference of the Parties (COP 21) held in Paris in late 2015. The long term goal adopted by GEB is the generation of 8676 GWh/year by the end of year 2025 (around the 10% of national generation capacity from renewals expected in 2025).  In 2017, GEB voluntarily adhered to the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative with the purpose of setting reduction goals in keeping with international agreements and the voluntary reduction commitments adopted by Colombia.

Data consistency and quality: Occasionally our sites receive updated utility information, for example replacing estimated consumption with actuals. This can happen sometime after the reporting period and when the reporting system is updated it can have an impact to emissions reported, leading to small changes year on year.  Targets: In 2016 our climate targets were approved by SBTi, in 2019 we received confirmation that they are in line with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, the most ambitious scenario of the Paris Agreement. Ambition Zero Carbon was launched by our CEO at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January 2020, where we committed $1billion to three main pillars of the strategy: reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to zero by 2025; switch our inhaler portfolio to next generation inhalers using near-zero global warming potential propellants (first launch 2025); and plant 50 million trees globally by 2025 to restore the lungs of the planet. With the launch of the combined Scope 1 and 2 target within Ambition Zero Carbon, the individual Scope 1 target was replaced.

In order to complement the company’s internal efforts, since 2014 TIM has invested in the purchase of carbon credits to offset part of its emissions.  In the Scope 1 , the TIM sought to gain more in-depth understanding of this question by calculating its carbon footprint, a study which measures a product or service’s specific GHG emissions during the course of its life cycle. The analysis showed that each 1 Mb of data transmitted over 4G technology results in an emission of 1.47 g of CO2 e. The major stages affected in the company’s operations are related to burning diesel in generators and consuming electricity.

Despite the Covid‑19 public health crisis and if no action is taken, the forecasts for global air traffic growth in the coming years could, however, see this proportion increase. The aviation industry is the first economic sector to have set ambitious long‑term reduction targets and to have adopted a worldwide carbon offsetting system within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to guarantee carbon‑neutral growth for global air transportation as of 2020. In 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) thus set ambitious worldwide targets for reducing the CO2 emissions from air transportation: — 1.5% average annual fuel efficiency improvement until 2020; — carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards; — a 50% reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions in 2050 relative to the 2005 level. While international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry’s efforts respond to the latter’s target of limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C. In its Energy Technology Perspectives 2017, the International Energy Agency considers that the airline industry’s target for 2050 is more ambitious than what would be required for a 2°C scenario (2°C Scenario – 2DS) and close to a scenario of beyond 2°C (Beyond 2°C Scenario – B2DS) without taking into account the effects of carbon offsetting.

Target status / performance overview: Our emissions from landfill fell by 37% in FY2017 compared to the base year, although our total volume of waste sent to landfill only fell by 22%. Our calculated waste recycling ratio in FY2016 fell to 91% (compared to 95% in FY2016), although we believe this still represents positive progress - from reducing both our absolute waste volumes and total waste sent to landfill in addition to a reduction in absolute emissions from waste.  This outcome is a product of the continued process improvements introduced by our Administrations & Workplace Services team to implement our waste segregation scheme in all UK offices and to look for more sustainable solutions to minimising and disposing of our waste. This comprises office floor recycling stations, food waste minimisation and redistribution programmes, waste paper from print activities as well as numerous events to engage our staff and raise awareness of the requirement for recycling effectively.

This is an important initiative to ensure that all stakeholders, including governments and companies, work together to address routine flaring. Flaring, or burning off, of gas in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses contributed around 8% of our overall direct GHG emissions in 2019. Around 25% of this flaring took place at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas produced with oil, known as associated gas. Around 35% of flaring in our Upstream and Integrated Gas facilities in 2019 took place in assets operated by The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). Flaring from SPDC-operated facilities fell by around 20% between 2015 and 2019. Flaring intensity levels in SPDC in 2019 increased by around 10% compared to 2018. SPDC continues to make progress in close collaboration with its joint-venture partners and the Federal Government of Nigeria towards the objective of ending the continuous flaring of associated gas.

However, the oil produced at Peshkabir had higher than expected associated gas content. Consequently, the Tawke license became by far the largest contributor to DNO’s GHG emissions, (598,222 tonnes CO2e in 2019). For this reason, in 2019 a target was set for the emissions at Tawke license to be reduced by at least two-third (66.67%) within five years (by 2024). The target was set for this facility (the Tawke license) as it is the largest source of DNO’s scope emissions (598,222/632,512=95%).  The reduction of emissions was to be achieved through a two-phase gas injection project (instead of flaring).   The first phase of the project (commissioned in mid 2020) involved capturing and processing associated gas produced at the Peshkabir field and pipelining it to the nearby Tawke field (within the same license). At the Tawke filed, the transported gas is injected underground for reservoir pressure management. The cost of this project was USD 110 million. By end of 2020, DNO captured, pipelined and reinjected a total of 2.4 billion cubic feet (bcf) of Peshkabir field associated gas - which otherwise would have been flared - into the Tawke field for pressure maintenance (in addition to another 0.3 bcf reinjected at the Peshkabir field itself).   Phase 2 of the project will capture and reinject into the Tawke field any associated gas produced at the Tawke filed. This project is in the final stages of review before contract award and it is expected to finish in 2022-2023 at cost of USD 30 million. This project will materially reduce flaring of associated gas at the Tawke field and help with reservoir pressure maintenance and oil recovery.  Once Phase 1&2 are commissioned, flaring emissions in the Tawke license will drop significantly. Although uncertain (depending on reservoir performance), we forecast in 2024, on an average, 21 MMscf (million standard cubic feet) per day of otherwise flared associated gas will be injected. This compares to 22.1 MMscf per day of associated gas flaring in 2019.

There is a triennial rationalization plan for energy consumption wich implies a 5% reduction. This legal requirement implies also an Anual Report on Progress with anual audits. The rationalization plan for energy consumption in progress for this target is 2015-2018. For this purpose only the year base is considered 2015 and ended at the end of the year 2018. During 2018 Luis Simões' transport fleet showed a reduction in specific consumption of 4.67% compared to the base year of the rationalization plan (2015), with this indicator at 287.46 gep/VK, result of the implementation of energy efficiency measures applied to the fleet. From the measures recommended in the rationalization plan, it can be seen that, regarding the change of the vehicles, about 200% is achieved beyond the recommended. Despite the efforts and high financial investment in the purchase of more efficient and efficiency-enhancing equipment (in the case of TMS) it was not possible to achieve a 5% reduction, but it was considerably close, with a deviation of only 0,34%.

Therefore 53% of the emission reduction are achieved (4.457.000-4.197.000 / 4.457.000-3.966.730 = 53%)  This target corresponds with an average annual reduction rate of 2.2% (11%/5years=2.2%). This means that the achieved emissions reduction (53%) is greater than the percentage of time from start year (2 year/ 5 years=40%). Further information: The target is in line with the long-term target for 2045 (line below). Instead of a linear reduction path with constant annual reduction rates we expect gradual development of our emissions. Our Scope 1 emissions are associated with few energy production assets. The future decommissioning of fossil power plants will therefore result in a drop of our emissions. The next jump discontinuity is expected until 2020 as a result of the decommissioning of the coal-fired power plant in Kiel (GKK). In this respect target Abs1 and Abs2 are part of the same emission reduction path. However, in case of unexpected future changes in business strategy, M&A, changing energy regulation or energy production capacities it might become necessary to adjust the current target. Therefore this target can be understood as emission reduction potential in a business-as-usual case (aside from changes in business, regulation and markets).

Due to significant improvements on the calculation methods, and therefore corrections to the 2019 carbon footprint, and the inability to revise the 2018 calculations, the base year is no longer 2018 but 2019.   The target was defined in accordance with the recommendations of the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative. The sector-wide approach was thus preferred, based on the tools of the Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (SDA) developed by the International Energy Agency. Due to the lack of 1.5°C scenario data from IEA, SBTi currently does not provide an SDA option for 1.5°C targets, so the Absolute Contraction Approach was also used. The target coverage include emissions related to energy consumption (electricity, heating, cooling).  The emissions generated by the electricity consumed have been quantified according to market-based and location-based methods since 2020. Electricity-related emissions for 2019 were recalculated in accordance with this methodology. Fnac Darty has chosen the market-based method to monitor its performance, in particular its responsible energy purchasing policy. Emissions related to market-based electricity are calculated on the basis of the emission factors provided by the Group’s various electricity suppliers. When these are not available, the calculation is based on the supplier’s production capacity mix. The consumption associated with each energy source is then multiplied by the emission factors specific to each energy (Base Carbone) corresponding to the emission phase. For European countries and for the recalculation of French emissions in 2019, Fnac Darty calculates market-based emissions based on the residual mix (source AIB), as it was not possible to get the emission factors of the various electricity suppliers in 2019, which changed in 2020. This explains a large part of the decrease between 2019 and 2020. It will be possible to truly monitor the Group's performance on renewable energy purchases in 2021, when the methodology will be identical.

The probability is estimated by the IPCC at a minimum of 66 percent. The IEA 2°C scenario estimates an overall carbon budget of 1,055 GtCO2 up to 2050.

This target was originally set using the SDA methodology, based on a 2-degree warming scenario, using a 2015 base year and a total projected growth rate (in square meters) of 10% during the period.  The base year emissions were consolidated using an Equity-Share based approach. The approach incorporates all of Emira owned asset emissions in scope 1 and scope 2, even if these emissions are controlled by Emira tenants or are part of an investment in a global property portfolio over which Emira has no control.    During the current reporting period, Emira analysed and reported on Corporate emissions as per the Financial-Control consolidation approach. This was done to align with global best practice and Emira's own integrated reporting where investments are treated as ""indirect"" assets.   As per this new approach all assets under the financial control of Emira are included as scope 1 and 2 emissions, including the tenant portion of asset  usage. However, investments in global asset funds are treated as scope 3 emissions.    Emira is currently in the process of resubmitting  a more ambitious 1.5DS target under the SBTi.  In doing so, the new target will be re-stated as per the financial control approach.

For energy related activities, we decided to set emission reduction targets aligned with scope 2 target (since the reduction is related and will happen in parallel), on an Absolute contraction approach in line with a 1.5 degree scenario (1.5C), for a 5 year target, therefore 21% reduction. We have used the SBT tool and SDA methodology to meet SBT criteria.  Amdocs main scope 3 emissions are business travels (68.8% of scope 3 emissions and 43.8% of total GHG emissions), fuel and energy related activities (15.5% of scope 3 emissions and 9.9% of total emissions) and employee commuting - employees leased cars for commuting and personal use (6.1% of scope 3 emissions and 9.6% of total emissions).

Due to this a target was developed based around a additional target for a 30% reduction in energy consumption (accounting for degree days) by 2020 from a 2013 baseline.  In 2017 DLG announced a 57% Scope 1 & 2 emission reduction target by 2020 on a like-for-like basis against a 2013 baseline.  In the first half of 2020, DLG contracted the Carbon Trust to verify our Scope 1 & 2 emissions numbers and calculate our Scope 3 emissions (excluding Investments). During this process, the Carbon Trust uncovered additional vehicles used during repairs, courtesy car fuel usage and employee jobs-need vehicles, which has not previously been tracked or reported.  Therefore, the Scope 1 figure reported here 9,399 verified by the Carbon Trust , differs from what was reported in the 2019 Annual Report & Accounts, 7,365.   As these activities were not tracked in 2013, the like-for-like comparison to our 2013 baseline is impossible.

SBTi response: Targets cover all scope 1 & 2 emissions in the company’s GHG inventory, developed in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Targets for scope 1 and 2 cover 98% of the company’s scope 1 and 2 emissions. The GHG inventory and scope 1 and 2 target covers all relevant GHGs. The company reported direct carbon emissions from combustion of biofuels and/or biomass. The relevant emissions are included in the scope 1 and 2 target boundary. The company included all relevant subsidiary emissions in GHG inventory and target boundary.  The scope 1 and 2 target year is seven years from the date of target submission.. The required reduction between the most recent year that a GHG inventory is available and the scope 1 and 2 target year is sufficiently ambitious, to be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5 C compared to pre industrial temperatures. The target has been assessed against the absolute contraction approach endorsed by the SBTi.  Please note:  1) The scope of this goal  is different than the scope of Abs1, since the  production sites in Brazil (LPA) are included, which were acquired end of 2019 due to the significant volume of milk processed by them (322’724’401.00 kg in 2019) and corresponding energy consumption / emissions.  The Scope for Abs 1 does not include LPA data. Hence, the GHG emissions for 2020 are different in Abs and Abs 2. LPA's Scope 1 emissions are 4'568 t CO2eq in 2019, mostly caused by the diesel for the generator, while they cover most of their heat demand by wood . LP's S2 emissions are 2'699 t CO2eq in 2019. 2) Change of S2 methodology: We switched from a location-based to a market-based approach of reporting Scope 2 emissions, supported by Quantis in the process of establishing the 2019 GHG baseline for SBTi submission. Also, we split emissions from electricity from only S2 (as previously done) to Scope 2 and Scope 3 (Cat.3).  We will report with the 2019 base year in the future i.e. also for  next CDP Reporting.
