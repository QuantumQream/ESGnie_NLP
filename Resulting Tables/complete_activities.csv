11,"A target was set in order to reach an overall 10% increase in energy savings (for Italian plants), due to the installation of new furnaces with the best available combustion control techniques and with the best efficiency performances. In 2013 we substituted furnace 2 in Fossalta, in 2014 furnace 4 and in 2015 furnace 3, both in Empoli. Finally we have substituted furnace 1 in Fossalta in 2017. Each one of these initiatives generates a fallout in terms of efficiency increase and emissions decrease in the timeframe of about a year. The 10% increase in energy savings leads to about a 8,8% decrease in scope 1 and 2 combined emissions. This target was reported also last year, with Abs1 reference.

(Referred as “Abs1”) •Medium-term frame: reduce by 15% and 25% our scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2025 and 2030, respectively.  (Referred as “Abs2” and “Abs 3”) •Long-term frame: reduce by 61% our scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2040 and become neutral carbon neutral by 2050. Referred as “Abs4”)  Targets “Abs3” and “Abs4” are new and also raise the level of ambition of the ones included in our 2019 CDP response - reference ""Abs4"" and “Abs5” in 2019 CDP which have, therefore, been retired.  This path has been established considering international initiatives such as We Mean Business, Global Methane Alliance, and Methane Guiding Principles.  Targets “Abs2”, “Abs3” and “Abs4” are considered to be targets in line with science. Given that the SBTi do not have a specific methodology for the O&G sector (pending to be published) we have followed the methodology available. We have also used the compounded reduction rate to set the target’s level of ambition following the guidelines set by CDP in its “Technical note on science-based targets” making sure that our targeted % reduction from base to target year is ≥1− (1 − 0.021)^( target year-base year)%. Once the O&G Methodology is published by the SBTi targets may be adjusted.  “Abs4” is a new target aligned with the 1.5ºC scenario. Emissions resulting in 2019 (310,162 tCO2) have remained almost constant (+1.8%) despite the sharp increase in the level of activity (+14% domestic demand) as a result of greater energy efficiency. Carbon neutrality in 2050 will be achieved implementing further emission reduction initiatives and offsetting.

Toscana Energia was only consolidated for 3 months in 2019, hence the baseline is recalculated to reflect 12 months of Toscana Energia for 2019. The target covers 100% of group Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2020 data). The target anticipated an increase in leak detection activity with an initial stable/higher emissions and a drop after, on the back of actions implemented The great majority of Italgas emissions are fugitive emissions originated from gas distribution while Scope 2 emissions are very small. Thanks to the digital transformation of the network and the technological innovations implemented in leak detection Italgas expects that by 2026 it will have reduced methane emissions by 20% as reported in its 2020-26 Strategic Plan and other emissions. As regards leak detection, in 2018, Italgas introduced and now makes extensive use of CRDS (Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy) technology developed by Picarro. It consists of a sophisticated sensing technology that, compared with traditional technologies, offers important advantages in terms of the speed of conduct and extent of areas under control. Relative to a regulatory requirement to inspect the whole network on a 3 to 4 years rolling basis, with Picarro, Italgas plans to inspect the whole network at least annually. Further Picarro can detect leaks with a sensitivity three times greater than that currently used by all other industry operators (parts per billion vs parts per million); identify a gas leak even a few dozen meters away from the route covered by the equipped vehicle thanks to specific on-board sensors and sophisticated calculation software. Thanks to this technology, Italgas is the only operator in Italy to carry out scheduled gas leakage detection, also extended to all the underground and overhead connections, albeit this activity is not prescribed by current legislation and regulations. Thanks to the results of Picarro, Italgas is able to intervene on leaks much more quickly, reducing dispersions of methane, and on even small dispersions. Internal requirements on time of intervention on assessed leaks have been harshened. Other measures include lower energy consumption for industrial and civil uses, vehicle fleet optimisation.

The overall portfolio target is to reduce portfolio companies’ scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2016. This is an absolute reduction target for the overall portfolio (not an equity approach). The reason for setting the target on the total level is to drive all our portfolio companies to reduce their emissions and not be able to divest in companies with higher emissions. The baseline is set to 2016 to align our strategy period with Agenda 2030 and the Global Sustainability Goals.  In 2019, greenhouse gas emissions from our overall portfolio decreased by 29 percent compared to 2016.

At the end of 2015, L’Oréal went further than this goal, reaching a -56% of CO2 emissions reduction. The Sharing Beauty With All program has set in 2013 a new ambitious target of -60% reduction in 2020 with the same 2005 baseline. The baseline is managed and revised according to the GHG Protocol, and takes into account new acquisitions and divestments. In 2016, this objective has been converted from a ""net objective"" into a ""Market-Based"" objective, following the evolution of the GHG Protocol; this “Market-Based” approach has also been applied to the 2005 baseline. Through a continuous improvement approach, in 2016, the reporting of Scope 1 emissions has been improved by taking into account at Operations level the emissions coming from cooling gas leaks. In 2016, the “Working Sustainably” program has been launched for our administrative and research sites (see target below Abs 4).  End of 2018, L’Oréal exceeded its 2020 objective: the GHG emissions of Operations sites (which represents 62% of the total scope 1 and 2 in 2018) have been reduced by 77% compared to 2005, in absolute terms, while increasing the production by 38% at the same time, thereby confirming that ambitious commitment in favour of the climate can go hand-in-hand with economic success.  L’Oréal has drafted a strategy involving the use of renewable energies, based on the potentialities offered by each local context that allows some sites all over the world to use locally produced renewable energy, or to directly produce their own renewable energy (biomass, biomethanisation, solar panels, etc.).

The indicator used for this target (net GHG lifecycle emissions) is part of the new metrics defined by the methodology, which include Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, in absolute and relative terms, linked to the energy products sold accounted on an equity basis. This list of products includes: oil & gas, electricity and also new bio products originating from new circular economy business. For each of these products, the methodology envisages inclusion of all material sources of GHG emissions generated along their value chain, according to a well-to-wheel approach.  The official target was communicated during Strategy 2020 and represents absolute emissions reduction by 2050 of 80% at net of carbon sinks. In line with CDP guidance, the target reported in this section (-71% by 2050 versus 2018) represents an estimation of the Gross emissions reduction, obtained by subtracting the role of sinks, according to published targets for CCS (>10MtCO2e by 2050) and Forestry (>30 MtCO2e by 2050). Even if the target is not yet approved by the Science Based Target Initiative (the methodology for Oil & Gas and Integrated Energy companies is still in development), we consider it a Science Based Target because it includes scope 3 and the reduction by 2050 exceeds the 70% threshold indicated by the IEA SDS scenario, that is compatible with the targets set by the Paris Agreement.",5,0.58818614,"Electricity Efficient Lighting, Air-Conditioning and Refrigerants in Work Plants"

On scopes 1 and 2, reducing emissions from 2010 base year will necessitate reducing annual emissions to 2830410 metric tons while absorbing our organic growth. To date Michelin is on track to meet this scope 1 and 2 ambition by 2030. Recalculation of base year emissions for SBTi submission: As described in our 2015 registration document (p 178), the same emission factor was used until 2014 for all of the sites purchasing steam, regardless of the primary energy or technology used by the vendor.  As of 2015, in order to more accurately depict foreseeable developments in energy sourcing, we decided to use three emissions factors, one for each primary energy used (coal, fuel oil and gas), including reasonable energy efficiency and loss assumptions.  When we were preparing our submission to SBTi and, in this framework, we recalculated our 2010 (base year) emissions with the new emission factors (EF) applied to steam purchases: with the new EFs, our 2010 emissions would have been 3,850,000 tonnes instead of 4,067,000. For simplicity reasons in our internal communication and target setting, our short term, non-submitted to SBTi 2020 target set is still based on our historical 2010 emission value (4,067,000 tonnes). However, the recalculated 2010 base-year emissions (3,850,000 tonnes) is the basis for our SBTi submission (2030 and 2050 targets).",21,0.6161907,Renewable Energy (Switch/Invest) in Solar and Wind

694,"This absolute Scope 3 target to reduce Ball's GHGs 16% against a 2017 baseline is part of its approved SBTs.   This increase was anticipated because Ball updated its calculation approach to purchased metals to better align with its customers. Different methodologies exist for calculating the embedded GHG emissions of materials such as aluminum. The main difference stems from how recycling credits are being allocated for the material: 1.) A material can get the full credit for avoided emissions by only considering the amount of recycled material used when producing the material (called recycled content, cut-off, or 100:0 allocation). 2.) Or, one can argue that products – like fast moving consumer goods – should get a credit for their real end-of-life recycling rate because only a product that is recyclable and actually recycled creates environmental benefits by replacing the need for more resource and energy intensive production of virgin materials (called end-of-life recycling, substitution, or 0:100 allocation). There is no scientific consensus around which methodology is most appropriate when calculating embedded GHG emissions. Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased metals published by Ball prior to 2020 were based on the 20:80 method and relied on industry average recycled content values published by regional aluminum trade associations, and recycling rates published by governments and – where not available - estimates based on research conducted by Ball and its partners. In 2020 Ball used the 100:0 approach because Ball has primary data (supplier-specific recycled content values) which will  more accurately account for our GHG footprint from purchased metals. Average emission factors for primary aluminum and steel are calculated by adjusting the average grid mix impact. If no specific emissions factor exists for specified tons of purchased metal from a supplier/country/site/metal, then a default figure for that country is used.   Ball updated its 2017 baseline Scope 3 data to the 100:0 approach for internal SBT tracking purposes, but Ball has not yet submitted this revision to the SBTi for approval. Companies re-baseline and re-submit their SBT data every 5 years. Thus, for this reporting period Ball maintains the 2017 baseline Scope 3 data as it was first submitted to the SBTi, but the 2020 data have been updated to the 100:0 approach as described above.",23,0.758165,Recycling

1114,"Salzgitter Group has established a project called SALCOS® (Salzgitter Low CO2 Steelmaking) which deals with the avoidance of CO2 emissions in steel production in an integrated steel mill. The Salzgitter Group operates an integrated steel site in Salzgitter, accounting for roughly 95 % of the group-wide Scope 1 CO2 emissions. Recently the steel production at this site is done via the conventional and worldwide established so called blast furnace / blast oxygen furnace route. Unavoidably on this carbon-based production route, around 1.5 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel (without emissions e.g. from ore preparation and coke making) occur during the reduction process. This limit has been more or less reached by the steel production in Salzgitter as well as by many other steel sites in Europe. Due to this, Salzgitter Group is investigating an opportunity to produce steel using mainly green hydrogen instead of carbon, leading to far lower CO2 emissions. This would be an approach of carbon direct avoidance (CDA) which differs from other approaches like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture and usage (CCU). But such approaches are less energy efficient than SALCOS®. Our project has reached a high publicity in the European politics in the last years, the open question is, whether this technically possible approach can be feasible in Europe in economic terms. Up to 2050 a step by step CO2 reduction up to 95% might be possible from a technical point of view. For the time being a preliminary project phase called MACOR has been finalized successfully a feasibility study, finding out all information needed for SALCOS® potentially. In addition to this, several pilot projects has been built up together with partners at the Salzgitter steel site for testing the integration of hydrogen production into the steel production processes.

Linde has therefore set itself a CO2 avoidance target which means a specific absolute amount of CO2 needs to be saved (6 Mio tons CO2 = 41.6% of baseline year CO2 emissions of 14.4 Mio tons) compared to the amount of emissions which would be caused by our business without any climate actions being taken.  DETAILS ON EMISSION AVOIDANCE TARGET:   By 2020, we are seeking to avoid a total of 6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions compared to the year 2009 due to plant design and operational improvements, of which 4.8 million tonnes in air separation plants (scope 2 emissions) and 1.2 million tonnes in HyCO plants (scope 1 emissions).  By the end of 2017, we had avoided a total of 4.1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (=28.5% of 14.4 Mio baseline year emissions), of which 0.9 million tonnes were direct emissions and 3.2 million tonnes were indirect emissions.

Now, these are being replaced with the six new full-container ships and we’re estimating this will result in a savings of nearly 19 thousand metric tons of fuel each year. Each vessel also meets the most stringent emission control regulation and includes:  • An Integrated Condition Monitoring System in all the machinery and combustion engines in the vessel, the purpose of which is to continuously calculate and identify areas for efficiency improvements.  • Alternate Marine Power (AMP), an anti-pollution method that stops the consumption of diesel fuel and minimize air pollution when the vessel halts at a port.  • A new Hull design at the front of the ship, to increase speed, range, efficiency and stability.  • Hybrid Exhaust Gas Scrubber system to reduce any harmful sulfur oxides that may be emitted from the exhaust gases.

Energy Efficiency Program - We accelerate proof points for our customers for carbon technologies by planning to invest up to EUR 100 million in energy efficiency measures at our sites: most of the applied solutions are part of our portfolio and we expect a payback within five years and annual savings of up to EUR 20 million. 2. Distributed Energy Systems - We will create showcases of distributed energy systems at our own sites (e.g. combining power generation, such as wind, PV with storage solutions and intelligent energy management technologies) 3. Car Fleet - Our car fleet (about 48,000 vehicles accounting for roughly 300,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions) is included in our CO2-neutral aspiration. We will continue to include CO2 emission factors as an integral part of our local car fleet policies around the world 4. Green Electricity: We are changing our power purchasing guidelines and move towards a significantly cleaner power mix with a focus on renewable energies and gas. We also aim at creating opportunities for further businesses as part of green electricity purchase (PPA) projects.

Each business has established its climate roadmap using two scenarios, the focal points of which have varied from one business to another depending on their activities. These scenarios are based on the work of the IEA (International Energy Agency) and were carried out with the Carbone 4 firm. - Two types of 1.5 ° C scenarios leading to a low-carbon society have been developed: o The first so-called ""Pro-techno"" scenario estimates that the socio-environmental transition is based mainly on technological innovation which makes it possible to maintain GDP growth while significantly reducing environmental impacts (decoupling). o The second scenario called “Sobriety” considers that the socio-environmental transition is based on resilience and societal changes by adopting new objectives of prosperity and social growth. - The scenario analysis exercise then consisted in projecting the current activities of each Business Line in these low-carbon transformation scenarios and identifying how the transformation of the “business playground” induced by the scenario positively affected or negatively the activities of the Trade. - The risks and opportunities were thus identified, making it possible to understand the resilience of the current strategy of each Business Line in contrasting contexts of low-carbon transformation of the economy. Reduction projections were made based on climate scenarios and trajectories to set the level of ambition of the efforts to be made by the businesses.

1753,"In 2017, Emira set its Science Based Target of committing to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 13% by 2022 from a 2015 base-year.   This target was originally set using the SDA methodology, based on a 2-degree warming scenario, using a 2015 base year and a total projected growth rate (in square meters) of 10% during the period.  The base year emissions were consolidated using an Equity-Share based approach. The approach incorporates all of Emira owned asset emissions in scope 1 and scope 2, even if these emissions are controlled by Emira tenants or are part of an investment in a global property portfolio over which Emira has no control.    During the current reporting period, Emira analysed and reported on Corporate emissions as per the Financial-Control consolidation approach. This was done to align with global best practice and Emira's own integrated reporting where investments are treated as ""indirect"" assets.   As per this new approach all assets under the financial control of Emira are included as scope 1 and 2 emissions, including the tenant portion of asset  usage. However, investments in global asset funds are treated as scope 3 emissions.    Emira is currently in the process of resubmitting  a more ambitious 1.5DS target under the SBTi.  In doing so, the new target will be re-stated as per the financial control approach.    However, for the purpose of current target tracking and this CDP response, the equity based approach is used, and therefore covered emissions reported here are not aligned to the total scope 1 and 2 emissions reported in the rest of this CDP questionnaire.     In 2019, the  target was recalculated to take into account all acquisitions and divestment's, in line with the recalculation policy of Emira.

In both sectors, the application potential for our innovative CCU solutions (such as C2C & Oxyfuel) is significant. They enable our customers to reduce emissions by capturing CO2 from CO2-intensive processes & using it for the production of base chemicals, thereby replacing fossil feedstock. Furthermore, our solutions contribute to the required transformation towards an economy powered to a high extent by renewable energy carriers like hydrogen. With our technologies such as water electrolysis, we contribute to renewable power generation and storage. It is by these measures, backed by cross-Group R&D activities, that we seek to decrease our scope 3 emissions by 16% until 2030.

To achieve -100% absolute scope 1+2 emission reductions Metsä Board has a roadmap to 2030 including investments and changes that will be made at each mill site. These actions will enable a switch from fossil fuels to bio-based fuels, electrifying some of the processes which currently use fossil-based natural gas, and improvement of energy-efficiency of the mills. The biggest investments will be made at Husum mill, including renewal of recovery boiler and turbine of the pulp mill as well as renewal of the fibre line. In addition to own energy production at MB's mills, all purchased energy will be based on fossil-free energy sources by 2030. This requires reconsideration of the current energy purchasing contracts.

We aim to achieve this by reducing the electricity imported by each of our operational sites, and through sourcing renewable electricity sources for each of our offices as renewables grow in their respective countries. We have achieved this in our Dublin office, where 100% of our electricity needs are emt by renewable sources. Our other offices are located in countries where renewables provide a small share of electricity to the system, but through our development of more renewable energy projects, we aim to increase the % share of electricity delivered to those offices which comes from renewable energies.

2699,"This target has been relaunched during Eni's strategy presentation in February 2021. The new reduction pathway foresees achieving net-zero GHG lifecycle emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in 2050, in line with the scenarios compatible with keeping global warming within 1.5°C, with two intermediate reduction targets of 25% by 2030 and of 65% in 2040. Target Abs 4 reported last year will therefore be reported in the ""Net Zero"" dedicated section C4.2c, and it has been reported here as ""revised"" giving the new 2040 intermediate reduction target.  The target is based on a distinctive methodology for the evaluation of all GHG emissions related to Eni’s energy products along the value chain. The indicator used for this target (net GHG lifecycle emissions) is part of the new metrics defined by the methodology, which include Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, in absolute and relative terms, linked to the energy products sold accounted on an equity basis. This list of products includes oil & gas, electricity and also new bio products originating from new circular economy business. For each of these products, the methodology envisages the inclusion of all material sources of GHG emissions generated along their value chain, according to a well-to-wheel approach. In 2021, the reporting model was further refined to better represent the actual use of the volumes sold to the market, including non-energy uses (e.g. petrochemicals) or those associated with decarbonized products (e.g. blue hydrogen, power with CCS). Therefore, base year data has been revised accordingly. The target communicated during Strategy 2021 represents the net absolute emissions reduction by 2040 of 65% at net of carbon sinks.   In line with CDP guidance, the target reported in this section (-54% by 2040 versus 2018) represents an estimation of the gross emissions reduction, obtained by subtracting the role of CCS and forestry. The role of these technologies at 2040 has been considered by linear interpolation of CCS and forestry targets communicated for 2030 (7 MtCO2e and 20 MtCO2e respectively) and 2050 (50 MtCO2e and 40 MtCO2e respectively).",15,0.52474266,Purchase Electricy with Guarantees of Origin and Renewable Certificates

2996,"SBT targets were set and approved for three businesses of the company namely MLDL, MWCDL (MWC Chennai), and MWCJL (MWC Jaipur) in 2019.    The Base Year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory for all the three businesses was recalculated in 2018 (i.e., FY 19) as part of SBTi; whereas the Base Year for MWCDL was considered as 2016, since the most comprehensive GHG inventory data was available for the same.  Reason for recalculation of GHG Inventory:  Earlier, for Residential Business i.e.; MLDL, we used to consider the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites and Contractors under Scope 1; but with detailed inventorisation in FY 19 as part of SBTi, the emissions from fuel consumption by Contractors alone were categorized under Scope 3 as per the GHG protocol, and the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites alone were considered under Scope 1. Similarly, the emissions from Electricity consumption for our Project sites and Contractors were considered under Scope 2; but as part of SBTi, the emissions from Electricity consumption by Contractors and Project sites were separately considered under Scope 3, and Scope 2 respectively. The same process was followed for MWCJL.             Segregation of the Fuel and Electricity Consumption by Project sites and Contractors was not possible for 2016 (i.e., FY 17) due to unavailability of separate data for sites and contractors; hence the base year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory was recalculated for FY 19 for the two business divisions - MLDL and MWCJL; whereas for MWCDL the Base Year was taken as 2016 as the complete inventory was available for the same.   The target as mentioned in this section, is target set for MWCDL. The Scope 1 & 2 emissions for MWCDL constituted about 100% of the total Scope 1 & 2 emission of the three business divisions in the base year (2016) as only MWCDL was with base year of 2016.

In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 20% by 2023 and 40% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions.  -Reduce emissions from energy consumption :  In 2020, the Group as reduced its energy consumption of 6% thanks to the low carbon strategy action plan dedicated to Operations. By the end of 2020, 23% of the Group’s workforce was employed in Group entities certified to ISO 50001 “Energy Management Systems”. In addition, 20 sites employing 16% of the Group’s workforce have obtained an environmental performance certification for buildings (HQE, BREEAM, etc.). In 2020, the Group continued to reduce its fossil fuel consumption (gas, fuel oil and coal), down 2.5% compared with 2018.   -  Reduce emissions related to the use of chemicals  : Along with energy, products with high global warming potential, used mainly in refrigeration systems, have been subjected to detailed action plans. Many sites have continued to replace high‑emitting refrigerants with equipment containing lower emitting refrigerants and have implemented action plans to limit leaks and, in some cases, even replaced the less efficient equipment. Thus, in 2020, SF6, one of the main greenhouse gases contained in air conditioning systems, was reduced to just 1% of Group CO2 emissions related to chemicals.  Total scope 1 emissions increased by 10% between 2018 and 2020, due to a 43% increase in CO2 emissions related to the use of chemicals (Kyoto Protocol).

Performance against the target: SSE’s target is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, based on 2018 levels. In comparison to the baseline year of 2017/18, SSE’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions fell by 31%.  The main contributing factors to this decrease included:  • Emissions from electricity generation activities: emissions fell as a direct result of the decarbonisation of the fuels used to generate electricity. The main cause for the emissions decrease was the closure of Fiddler’s Ferry. With the closure of its last remaining coal-fired power station, 2020/21 was the first year since 2005 that SSE’s generation fleet contained no electricity output from coal.  • Emissions from SSE’s electricity and gas consumption: SSE’s buildings and operations used less gas and electricity in comparison to the base year as a result of continued investments in energy efficiency measures combined with significantly lower emissions from electricity consumption as COVID-19 restrictions saw temporary closures of SSE’s non-operational buildings.   It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2030 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather-related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2030 target and the long-term trend continues to be significant reduction in the absolute emissions from the electricity it generates.

The method of calculation is derived from the Cradle to Grave method. Background The aim of the 2015 United Nations COP 21 Paris Agreement is to limit the increase of the global temperature above pre-industrial as much as possible. Recticel contributes to this aim by optimizing its carbon footprint throughout the value chain, alongside its partners. We focus on introducing raw materials with lower GWP (global warming potential) values as well as lower-carbon impact raw materials, improving the energy efficiency of our activities, and developing more sustainable products and end-of-life solutions that support a circular economy. We estimate that, in 2020, the CO2 emissions avoided by our insulation solutions offset over 46  times our carbon impact throughout the value chain, making the growth of this business a priority.  To optimize our carbon footprint, we want to reduce our negative impact and increase our positive impact in a significant way.

Polyols and isocyanates are fossil fuel-derived raw materials used to make polyurethane. The production of these chemicals is energy-intensive. Thus, our suppliers strive to optimize energy efficiency and find alternatives to fossil fuels.  Covestro developed a revolutionary new polyol that replaces 20% in weight with a by-product of the CO2 captured from a nearby facility.

Indeed, the average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2050 is 2.12%, which means that the contribution of EVs is one of the most important aspects in our long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions according to our target.  The percentages were calculated dividing the difference in emissions between start year and target year in relation to base year emissions.  In 2008, Nissan realised that further reductions also in terms of intensity may be necessary as suggested by the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. 450ppm represents the scenarios of Category I, and change in global CO2 emissions 2050 need to be half (50%) of 2000 which is re-calculated in WtW as -90%  in 2050, which is an intensity target applied for new vehicles (in g-C02/km).

To reduce our absolute emissions, we have the following emission reduction levers: 1)  We accelerate the energy transition by sourcing 100% of our energy from RES. 2) We apply state of the art initiatives such as the digitization of our smelters, and investigate new technologies that have the potential to decline direct smelting emissions by 100% and 3) We maintain or grow our secondary aluminium production reaching 50-75ktons of production.

Abs-2 addresses employee business travel (airline miles traveled) which encompasses 73% of all Scope 3 emissions. This target is science based by the 3% solution methodology of 3.2% p.a. reduction equating to 75% reduction over period from 2010 to 2020 for ALL Scope 3 emissions. Since the sole focus of ""ABS 2-Scope 3 Business Travel,"" is attributed to airline miles traveled, then the reduction goal needs to be more rigorous and reduced by 75% by 2025 to achieve 27.8% reduction if all other scope 3 sources remain constant (employee fleet commute). Based on this rationale, the following statements are true: a) Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions for baseline year 2010 are equivalent to 6,678 MTCO2e, b) a 38.1 % reduction in Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions below 2010 baseline levels is equivalent to 4,133 MTCO2e (6,678 MTCO2e -2,544 MTCO2e, = 4,133 MTCO2e, and c) Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions in calendar year 2019 were equivalent to 1,890 MTCO2E which is less than 4,133 MTCO2e.

Further information: The target is in line with the long-term target for 2045 (line below). Instead of a linear reduction path with constant annual reduction rates we expect gradual development of our emissions. Our Scope 1 emissions are associated with few energy production assets.

We are now working on our new corporate-wide science-based target of 25% reduction by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.  The methodology used to set our science-based target was the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) within the Sector-based approach. The SDA is a scientifically-informed method for companies to set GHG reduction targets necessary to stay within a 2°C temperature rise above preindustrial levels. The method is based on the 2°C scenario, one of the International Energy Agency’s detailed CO2 sector scenarios modeled in their 2014 Energy Technology Perspectives report. The Energy Technology Perspectives report’s budget is consistent with the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) scenario from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, which gives the highest likelihood of staying within the global target temperature of less than 2°C in the year 2100. The probability is estimated by the IPCC at a minimum of 66 percent. The IEA 2°C scenario estimates an overall carbon budget of 1,055 GtCO2 up to 2050. The SDA method was developed by the partners (CDP, WRI, & WWF) of the Science Based Targets initiative with technical support from Ecofys.

Transitioning to a decarbonized generation resource mix is a long and expensive undertaking. In 2019, the Company began to discuss and plan for setting a longer-term target beyond our initial 2032 carbon intensity target from the 2017 IRP. The primary driver of the Company’s commitment is to take steps to provide a clean energy future for our customers. The Company has been on a trajectory of increasingly clean energy through solar power innovation, major investments in energy storage technology, carbon-free nuclear operations and advances in energy efficiency solutions. Now, the Company has set the boldest clean-energy goal of all Arizona electric companies, as well as one of the most ambitious in the country, to reach 100 percent clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050. This goal includes a nearer-term 2030 target of 65 percent clean energy, with 45 percent of our generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. We also will cease all coal-fired generation by 2031. The commitment is informed by consultations with Arizona universities and non-governmental organization experts. Their input is grounded in current, globally recognized climate science and provides a greater understanding of the impacts of our changing climate across the state.

Originally set as a 53% reduction in 2050 vs 2015, in 2017 we have updated our target to a 60% reduction in 2050 vs 2017 to be in line with our new Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020.  Following the publication of IPCC's SR15 Report, in 2019 we have submitted a new target that was validated by the SBTi, with an increased ambition to achieve -65% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, and a -35% emissions from scope 3 within the same period, in line with 1.5°C required levels of ambition. During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our carbon footprint for all scopes in particular by: - including emissions from our company fleet in scope 1 (previously reported but in scope 3) - estimating scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites out of our environmental reporting scope (the scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001 certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All of the industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and the major tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation.

Building on that tradition, our 2025 GHG emissions goals aims to assure that GHG emissions are at least 50 percent below our 2002 baseline while still growing our business.  We are committed to innovate to decarbonize industry, accelerate climate solutions, and reduce our own environmental footprint. This commitment was launched through our Strategic Sustainability Framework (Science for Circular, Science for Climate, and Science for Community), on Investor Day 2018, by 3M’s Chief Executive Officer, and is rooted in our ambition to apply science for the greater good.  As a science-based company, 3M uses the World Resources Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to set GHG emission reduction targets. For this reason, we are incorporating the findings of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in setting our goals and actions.1 This report, prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries and based on over 6,000 scientific references, finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial temperatures would require “deep emissions reductions” and “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.” Achieving this goal also would “reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being.”",40,0.8085203,Market-Based

Developing access to competitive and low-carbon electricity for all in a world fighting against global warming The IPCC scenarios confirm it: to contain global warming to 1.5° C and continue to evolve in a sustainable world, nuclear power is not the only solution, but it is essential. The Paris Agreement on the fight against climate change provides for a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions and the European Union has set itself a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Orano intends to contribute to this collective mobilization.    In addition to being convinced of the role that nuclear power can play in the energy transition towards low-carbon electricity, Orano has been involved in a program to reduce its own emissions since 2004 in order to contribute to the collective effort. The group made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% between 2004 and 2020. Based on these results, Orano wants to go further in its contribution to carbon neutrality with a new target to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 15% by 2025 compared to 2019 (thus 2,5% reduction per year, aligned to the French National Low Carbon Strategy - SNBC for French Strategie Nationale Bas Carbone, which is aligned on the below 2° Paris Agreement).

4777,"Jean-Paul Agon, L’Oréal Chairman and CEO, announced in 2015 that the Group would completely balance its CO2 emissions from production and finished goods transportation by 2020, to become a carbon-balanced company.   The Group now pursues a twofold approach to reducing its carbon footprint:   1. Reducing emissions linked to its industrial activities by 60% by 2020, from a 2005 baseline, through the increasing use of renewable energy and improvements in the energy efficiency of its industrial sites (see objective above Abs3)   2. Counterbalancing by 2020 the rest of its emissions by generating carbon gains through the sustainable sourcing of raw materials in partnership with its suppliers, supporting them in their their low carbon transition process. With this new ambition, L’Oréal aims to balance its incompressible CO2 emissions (around 400,000 tons per year). This innovative approach will be rolled out through a range of projects with three focal points: improving energy efficiency; promoting low-carbon agriculture; developing sustainable forestry projects.   To ensure its approach is effective, L’Oréal has put together an expert committee of independent carbon specialists chaired by Christian de Perthuis, founder of the Climate Economics Chair. This target covers 100% of emissions in scope 1, scope 2 and downstream transportation of products in scope 3. It covers medium timeframe so as to completely counter balance its CO2 emissions from production by 2020, and continue until 2030 within the scope of our Science Based Targets.   While 4 projects are delivering carbon gains in 2017, the project portfolio is still under development in order to achieve our 2020 target: Identification of CO2 hotspots in raw materials supply chains, scoping studies, training webinars and calls for project proposals have been set up and shared with suppliers. In 2017, 45291 tons of CO2 emissions avoided were reported, 5 times more than the amount reported in 2016. This increase is due to the 2017 deliveries of CO2 ER from the 3 projects launched in 2016; the addition of 1 new project to the project portfolio; and the delivery of CO2 gains from 1 project already integrated to the portfolio in 2016 but which delivered 0 CO2 gain last year.

Goal is to reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 10% from 2015 to 2020.   This is measured by the electricity and greenhouse emissions intensity ratio per sq.m. including both communal and tenant areas. These ratios are normalised based on year of construction, vacancy, degree days and area and all electricity is 100% green.   In 2017 ASR DCRF started collecting actual usage data from the individual units. The results for 2018 have not arrived yet, therefore the results below are focussing on the collective consumption only. The tenant data will be disclosed in the GRESB 2019 and the Fund’s annual report 2020.  Since 2015, the electricity intensity ratio decreased by 24% and the greenhouse gas intensity ratio by 55%. Water consumption decreased by 41% since 2016 and waste increased by 4% since 2017. The Fund’s influence on the latter is relatively small since waste collection primarily is a municipal responsibility. The decreases show that the focus on its sustainable policy, acquisitions, maintenance and extensive sustainable renovation of the Fund’s current portfolio have had a positive impact on the performance indicators. As soon as the tenant consumption is disclosed, the Fund will decide whether or not to sharpen its reduction targets within the ASR DCRF Three Year Businessplan 2020-2022.

This goal is related to ISDIN's sustainability goals (Blue Wave program), more specifically with the change in the energy source of all ISDIN facilities in the world to a renewable source. This is a medium-term objective that will be completed by a long-term one, as ISDIN has already identified that there are facilities in regions that does not have a renewable energy supply or there is no information needed to assess the electrical energy mix and that, therefore, will required long-term strategies. ISDIN's business model, which prioritizes the lease or use of coworking facilities, requires the sharing of this target with the objectives of other companies. For this reason, ISDIN intends to carry out an engagement process in the following years with its installation partners to enable renewable energy contracts. In 2018, there was no energy consumed by ISDIN from renewable sources and the entire fleet was diesel or gasoline. This target meets the 2.1% year-on-year emission reduction between base year and target year. Once this target has been reached, even before the target year, ISDIN commits to maintain 100% renewable energy contracts beyond 2030 (see Abs2 target). In addition to the reduction in emissions associated to the generation of energy consumed by its plants, ISDIN has another metric to monitoring this target, namely: m2 of facilities using renewable energy. The evolution of this metric from the base year to the reporting year was: 2018 (0%), 2020 (83,36% mostly in Spain). This is a mid-term target (2030) and ISDIN has already managed to have 100% of its facilities in Spain with renewable energy and has started the transition of its own fleet. For the next years, ISDIN intends to pursue this objective in its facilities throughout Europe and in other countries that form the boundaries of this CDP.

We will also downsize our products by enhancing the functions of each component. The Precision Equipment Division, whose main products are FPD lithography systems and semiconductor lithography systems, we will reduce the GHG emissions by improving the functions of parts through technological development, reducing the number of parts and downsizing parts. Furthermore, we will set up a procurement project. Through the project, we will reduce GHG emissions per part by instructing our suppliers to manufacture parts more efficiently. Regarding countermeasures in Upstream transportation & distribution, in addition to promoting modal shift, we streamline the transportation route. We also standardize the packaging at the time of transportation and improve loading efficiency, thereby reducing GHG emissions.  99% of the emissions of Use of sold products is the emissions from product use of the Precision Equipment Business.

During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our scope 3 carbon footprint in particular by estimating emissions from the use of our products, as our products consume electricity and dissipate heat (Joule effect) during use phase. Emissions from use phase were estimated to 60,000,000 tCO2, representing over 84% of scope 3 emissions.  Nevertheless, our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations: -the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed -the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target). In addition, a vast majority of Schneider Electric’s products have long lifecycles, from up to 40 years. This directly translates into high use-phase emissions, compared to other industries with shorter-lifespan products, such as consumer electronics. Looking solely at use-phase induced absolute emission therefore generates a strong biais in the evaluation of the sustainability performance of offers, as companies producing durable products are penalized compared to other sectors.

However, we still have decided voluntarily to include it. Specifically, we have included category 3.3 in this first SBT target submitted corresponding to our Abs1 target, but we have also included category 3.1 and 3.2 in our supplier SBT target that we have also submitted (see target Abs3 for more details).  In order to achieve targets Abs1 and Abs2, our Department of Global Energy has launched the Energy Transition Plan based on the following four energy management mechanisms that include some specific actions to develop between 2021 and 2025: i) Principles of Energy 4.0 as intelligent measurement or digitization of processes and procedures related to energy. ii) Purchase of renewable energy (considering the different mechanisms available: energy purchase contracts (PPA), guarantees of origin, etc.). iii) Energy efficiency (offer the same service, but with a reduction in energy consumption). iv) Self-generation of renewable energy, especially by photovoltaic production in the same location to reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid.  With all these measures, it is expected to reduce not only the GHG emissions associated with scope 2 (purchase of electricity), but also the reduction of fuels in stationary sources, refrigerant gas leaks and WTT and T&D emissions related to energy.

Science-based targets: In 2014, when preparing to set new global targets against our base year (2014) we consulted Ecofys, consultant in renewable energy, energy & carbon efficiency, energy systems & markets and energy & climate policy. Ecofys, using the ‘Mind the Science’ methodology and tooling co-developed by Ecofys, CDP, WRI and WWF, conducted an assessment of our GHG emissions and inventory and calculated targets using the ‘convergence principle’ to map out a 2-degree pathway to 2020 using base year 2013 (see attached pdf ‘Mind the Science_SBT ING Group’). The result of this assessment was that ING should reduce absolute emissions by 10.7% by 2017 and by 18.1% by 2020 compared to 2013 in order to stay in line with the 2-degree pathway. The decision was made to push for a more ambitious target of 20% by 2020 and this was approved by the ING's Chief Operating Officer in 2015. We achieved this outcome in 2016 therefore we set new targets in 2017. These targets were proposed to ING’s Chief Operations Officer and members of the Board in 2017. The decision was to adopt this new ambitious target of 50% absolute emissions reduction and to keep our original base year of 2014. This decision means that our publicly communicated target is much more ambitious than the original target recommended via the Mind the Science tool by more than 31%. This reduction target is set against our total extrapolated scope 1,2 and 3 CO2 equivalent emissions which takes into account CO2, CH4 and N2O.

The targets are as follows: We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75% by 2030 and by 100% by 2040. We aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 and by 100% by 2050. They are introduced in the 2020 Sustainability Report (p. 50 ff.). The calculation methods for the E.ON carbon footprint were harmonised in 2020 due to the innogy takeover. innogy’s GHG emissions for 2019 were recalculated using the E.ON’s methods and emission factors and then aggregated with E.ON’s figures. This yielded a consistent baseline calculation.   The calculation of our emission reduction targets is based on the core policy scenario EUCO30. Moreover, we assume an improvement of energy efficiency and gas pipelines leading to a reduction on Scope 1 emissions by 1% annually and a 1% reduction of transmission and distribution losses of Scope 2 emissions.     In 2018 we underscored our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations by setting the target of making all E.ON buildings carbon-neutral by 2030. In 2020 we formed a project group tasked with designing a roadmap that consists of detailed measures to reduce our buildings’ carbon footprint and to foster sustainable property management. Each E.ON unit has the authority to pursue more ambitious emission-reduction targets that go beyond the targets for E.ON as a whole.

The methodology used to set our science-based target was the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) within the Sector-based approach. The Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) is a scientifically-informed method for companies to set GHG reduction targets necessary to stay within a 2°C temperature rise above preindustrial levels. The method is based on the 2°C scenario, one of the International Energy Agency’s detailed CO2 sector scenarios modeled in their 2014 Energy Technology Perspectives report. The Energy Technology Perspectives report’s budget is consistent with the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) scenario from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, which gives the highest likelihood of staying within the global target temperature of less than 2°C in the year 2100. The probability is estimated by the IPCC at a minimum of 66 percent. The IEA 2°C scenario estimates an overall carbon budget of 1,055 GtCO2 up to 2050.

During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our scope 3 carbon footprint in particular by estimating emissions from the use of our products, as our products consume electricity and dissipate heat (Joule effect) during use phase. Emissions from use phase were estimated to about 60,000,000 tCO2, representing over 84% of scope 3 emissions.  Nevertheless, our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations: -the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed -the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target). In addition, a vast majority of Schneider Electric’s products have long lifecycles, from up to 40 years. This directly translates into high use-phase emissions, compared to other industries with shorter-lifespan products, such as consumer electronics. Looking solely at use-phase induced absolute emission therefore generates a strong biais in the evaluation of the sustainability performance of offers, as companies producing durable products are penalized compared to other sectors. This is why, it is important to account for the emissions in the use phase of our products and engage in their reduction, but it is absolutely essential to underline the role that they are playing in the decarbonization of the economy.

In all Group areas also LED system lighting will be installed.  Moreover, the reduction of Scope 2 emissions include installation of LED lighting systems of the Rome public lighting grid. These and other measures will bring to a total reduction of 6,500 t of CO2 (in 2022) if compared to 2017 emissions. In the water sector, the water company Acea Ato2’s Energy Efficiency Plan has a target of 6 GWh to 2022 in waste water treatment sector. This target will be achieved through several optimization activities of biological oxidisation process in wastewater plants.

For the past four years (2017-2020) we achieved it: Google’s total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar exceeded the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including offices, data centers, and networking infrastructure. While we’re still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we’re purchasing enough wind and solar energy to match every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity our data center and office operations consume annually. In 2020, our annual GHG reductions from our renewable energy projects were 4.9 million metric tons. This puts us 341% of the way towards this goal from an emissions reduction perspective. Google is the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. From 2010 to 2020, we’ve signed more than 55 agreements totaling nearly 6 gigawatts of renewable energy.   Reaching our 100% renewable purchasing goal means that Google buys on an annual basis the same amount of MWh of renewable energy—both the physical energy and its corresponding renewable energy certificates (RECs)—as the amount of MWh of electricity that we consume for our operations around the world. Where possible, we buy this energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers.  Since we're using Abs2 as our interim target for Abs3 and it would be difficult to predict our emissions in 2040, we used most of the same data here for Abs3 as we did for Abs2.

In its target for renewable energy usage, Fujifilm strives to adopt renewable energies to cover 50% of electricity purchased by 2030, and raise the ratio to 100% by 2050. At the same time, the company will embrace new technologies, including the usage of renewables-based hydrogen fuel for in-house co-generation systems capable of generating high-temperature steam and electricity at the same time, thereby achieving zero carbon emissions in all energies used.

In 2016, GIGABYTE’s Green Action Plan entered into the third stage “Green Action 2.0”, of which the first phase was to reach the “reduction” goal.  For this purpose, we set the “333 Reduction Plan” with a target of reducing the entire Group’s carbon emissions, waste production and water consumption by 3% each year. Actually, this gaol does not have a target year as we did not set a termination year for the Green Action Plan 2.0. In order to reply to this question, we temporarily set 2030 as its target year, which is in accordance with the long-term goal, and therefore the accumulative reduction ratio is 45%. [Explanation of setting an SBT] GIGABYTE endeavors to reduce our negative impacts on the environment and have made effort to continue cutting the emissions generated from our operation. In order to ensure our emissions to be in line with or even below the emission level that aims to achieve the global 2°C goal, we tried to set a science-based target based on the methodologies and suggestions provided by SBTi. After researching, we decided to apply SDA and Absolute Contraction Approach which are best applied to our situation to help us understand how much effort we will have to make in the strictest scenario. The result showed that if we continue to keep our emission reduction rate in accordance with the current 50% target, it will exceed the 2°C level after 2022. That means we need to either reset a stricter target or set up a new target after 2022. We are still working on this issue.

The emissions generated by the electricity consumed have been quantified according to market-based and location-based methods since 2020. Electricity-related emissions for 2019 were recalculated in accordance with this methodology. Fnac Darty has chosen the market-based method to monitor its performance, in particular its responsible energy purchasing policy. Emissions related to market-based electricity are calculated on the basis of the emission factors provided by the Group’s various electricity suppliers. When these are not available, the calculation is based on the supplier’s production capacity mix. The consumption associated with each energy source is then multiplied by the emission factors specific to each energy (Base Carbone) corresponding to the emission phase. For European countries and for the recalculation of French emissions in 2019, Fnac Darty calculates market-based emissions based on the residual mix (source AIB), as it was not possible to get the emission factors of the various electricity suppliers in 2019, which changed in 2020.
